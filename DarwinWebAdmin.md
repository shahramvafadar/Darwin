2026-04-24 - WebAdmin public account CSRF smoke coverage completed: integration tests now verify tokenless login, register, 2FA, WebAuthn begin/finish, and logout POSTs are rejected before handlers, raising no-DB WebAdmin smoke coverage to twenty-seven passing tests.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin CultureController security smoke coverage added: integration tests now verify tokenless culture changes are rejected and external returnUrl values fall back to a safe local redirect while still setting the culture cookie, raising no-DB WebAdmin smoke coverage to twenty-four passing tests.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin localization smoke coverage added: integration tests now verify query-string culture selection and the CultureController cookie roundtrip drive auth-page html lang and selected language state under the real request-localization middleware, raising no-DB WebAdmin smoke coverage to twenty-two passing tests.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin permission-denied smoke coverage added: the test-authenticated client can now run with an allow-all or deny-all permission service, and integration tests verify admin fragments return Forbidden when authentication succeeds but permission evaluation fails, raising no-DB WebAdmin smoke coverage to twenty passing tests.

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin runtime CSRF smoke coverage added: integration tests now post to login, login-2fa, and logout without anti-forgery tokens and verify the real host rejects those account mutations with BadRequest while still emitting CSP and nosniff headers.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin production HSTS smoke coverage added: integration tests now use a non-local HTTPS host to verify the non-development pipeline emits Strict-Transport-Security alongside CSP, complementing the forwarded-proto smoke coverage.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin authenticated no-DB smoke foundation added: the WebAdmin test factory can create a test-authenticated client with an allow-all permission service, and integration tests now verify an authenticated admin alerts fragment passes authorization and emits security headers without running dashboard database queries.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin public auth smoke coverage expanded: integration tests now cover the register page with anti-forgery/default culture validation assets and the 2FA entrypoint redirect path without TempData, raising no-DB WebAdmin smoke coverage to eight passing tests.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin anonymous smoke coverage expanded: integration tests now assert the runtime anti-forgery cookie is Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite=Lax, and verify local static admin assets such as HTMX, vendor-manifest.json, and admin-core.js are served from WebAdmin with CSP and nosniff headers.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin forwarded-header smoke coverage added: the WebAdmin integration tests now send an HTTP request with X-Forwarded-Proto=https and verify the real pipeline treats it as secure, redirects unauthenticated users to the HTTPS login endpoint, and still emits strict security headers.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin production proxy readiness added: ForwardedHeadersOptions now enables X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto with optional configured known proxies/networks, and UseForwardedHeaders runs before HTTPS redirection so reverse-proxy scheme forwarding is honored for redirects, HSTS, and secure-cookie behavior.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin anonymous smoke tests now run without a real database: the Testing environment supplies a safe dummy DefaultConnection, uses a minimal console Serilog bootstrap instead of the file sink, and the WebAdmin test factory replaces ISiteSettingCache with static settings so unauthenticated redirect, security header, anti-forgery, and self-hosted asset smoke checks pass instead of skipping.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin vendor manifest completed: self-hosted frontend dependencies now include wwwroot/lib/vendor-manifest.json with audited version, license, source, and file mappings for Bootstrap, Font Awesome, HTMX, jQuery, jQuery Validation, unobtrusive validation, and Quill; source tests now guard manifest completeness in addition to local asset presence.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin integration smoke foundation added: Darwin.WebAdmin now exposes a public partial Program marker, a dedicated Darwin.WebAdmin.Tests project is included in the solution, and WebApplicationFactory smoke checks compile/host the real WebAdmin app for unauthenticated admin redirect, security headers, anti-forgery token rendering, and self-hosted asset loading when a test DB connection string is configured.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Razor compile cleanup completed: the new smoke project forced real Razor compilation and closed hidden compile errors from overloaded local URL helpers, nullable route ids, direct controller DB access in business communication readiness, and several admin workspace helper names; unit tests and WebAdmin smoke compilation now pass.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin auth/anti-forgery cookie hardening completed: the admin auth cookie and anti-forgery cookie now require SecurePolicy=Always, HttpOnly, and SameSite=Lax, anti-forgery uses the HTMX-compatible RequestVerificationToken header with a named Darwin.AntiForgery cookie, and source tests guard the cookie/token defaults.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin strict security headers added: Startup now emits Content-Security-Policy before static files with self-only script/style/font/connect sources and no unsafe-inline/unsafe-eval, allows data/blob images for existing admin media surfaces, and also sets X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy; source tests guard header ordering and policy shape.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin vendor frontend dependencies self-hosted: shared layouts and validation partials now load local versioned Bootstrap, Font Awesome, jQuery, HTMX, Quill, jquery-validation, and jquery-validation-unobtrusive assets from wwwroot/lib, with source tests guarding against external script/style regressions.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin CSP style cleanup completed: all Razor inline style attributes were replaced with local admin.css utility classes, source tests now guard against inline style regressions, and scans are clean for inline scripts, inline styles, javascript: URLs, raw hx-get Url.Action links, and fixed ToString("u") timestamps.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin AddOnGroups options editor inline script removed: localized option/value row HTML now lives in Razor template markup, add/remove behavior is handled by local versioned add-on-groups.js, and WebAdmin Razor views now scan with zero inline script blocks.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Page/Product Quill editors and the User address modal moved to local versioned JavaScript assets: content-editors.js initializes Page/Product Quill editors from data attributes and syncs hidden fields after DOMContentLoaded/HTMX swaps, admin-core.js owns the User address modal create/edit setup, and source tests guard those shells against inline script regressions.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Account login passkey placeholder plus CRM opportunity/customer dynamic line editors now use local delegated JavaScript: Login stores the localized passkey placeholder text in data-passkey-preparing-label handled by admin-core.js, CRM opportunity lines and customer addresses use data-dynamic-lines attributes handled by dynamic-lines.js, and source tests guard those surfaces against inline script regressions.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Media copy-url and ShippingMethods rate-tier JavaScript moved into local versioned wwwroot/js/media.js and wwwroot/js/shipping-methods.js; both surfaces are now guarded against inline script regressions while keeping localized labels in data attributes.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin dynamic line editor JavaScript moved into local versioned wwwroot/js/dynamic-lines.js: Billing journal-entry and Inventory purchase-order/stock-transfer create/edit pages no longer duplicate inline add/remove-line scripts and now use data-dynamic-lines attributes guarded by source tests.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin AddOnGroups reusable JavaScript moved into local versioned wwwroot/js/add-on-groups.js: attachment toggle-all, variant selection hidden-input sync, and currency uppercasing now use delegated data-attribute handlers, while tests guard that AddOnGroups views stay inline-script-free except for the localized _OptionsEditor template script.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin shared confirm-delete behavior is now centralized in wwwroot/js/admin-core.js: the shared modal no longer ships an inline script, delete success handling no longer uses data-hx-success or generated hx-on::after-request JavaScript, and address refresh/hide behavior now uses data attributes consumed by the central HTMX afterRequest handler.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin shared layout JavaScript moved out of Razor inline blocks into local versioned wwwroot/js/admin-core.js; the shared admin/auth layouts now load that asset with asp-append-version, read the alerts URL from a body data attribute, and source tests fail if shared layout inline scripts return.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin external asset hygiene is now source-guarded: external scripts/styles must stay on the reviewed version-pinned CDN allowlist, declare crossorigin="anonymous", and avoid misleading placeholder SRI values; layout CDN tags were normalized accordingly.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin inline event handlers are now removed and source-guarded: culture switchers use delegated change listeners, ShippingMethods rate-tier controls use data-shipping-rate actions with an idempotent delegated click handler, and tests now fail if inline on* attributes return.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Razor rendering safety is now source-guarded: tests fail if views reintroduce Html.Raw, HtmlString, javascript: URLs, or target=_blank links without both noopener and noreferrer; Media asset open links now carry full rel protection.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin file-upload hardening is now source-guarded: IFormFile and direct file IO are confined to the hardened Media pipeline, and tests now require the extension allowlist, 5 MB limit, server-generated filenames, uploads-root write path, content hash, and public URL contract to stay intact.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin anti-forgery ignore exceptions are now source-guarded: UploadQuill documents why Quill multipart uploads are the only [IgnoreAntiforgeryToken] exception, and unit tests fail if any other WebAdmin action introduces an anti-forgery bypass or if that exception loses its strict file-validation rationale.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin raw error leakage is now source-guarded across the full controller surface, not only Controllers/Admin: unit tests fail if any WebAdmin controller starts returning raw ex.Message, result.Error, or unsafe Problem/BadRequest/TempData/ModelState fallbacks instead of localized safe failure messages.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin admin-controller authorization is now source-guarded: unit tests ensure AdminBaseController keeps [PermissionAuthorize("AccessAdminPanel")], every controller under Controllers/Admin inherits from that protected base and avoids [AllowAnonymous], and the non-admin controller surface remains explicitly limited to account and culture endpoints.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin controller-side POST anti-forgery is now source-guarded: unit tests enumerate controller [HttpPost] action attribute blocks and fail unless each action has [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] or an explicit [IgnoreAntiforgeryToken] exception, aligning controller validation with the Razor form/token guards.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin non-HTMX POST forms are now source-guarded alongside HTMX mutations: unit tests enumerate every Razor <form method="post"> and fail if the form body does not include an anti-forgery token, covering account, culture/logout, full-page admin actions, and HTMX forms under one regression floor.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin HTMX target/swap consistency is now source-guarded: CRM lazy loaders and order detail tab loaders now declare explicit hx-target="this" beside their swap behavior, and unit tests enumerate every Razor tag with hx-get/hx-post to fail if target or swap behavior is left implicit.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin delete-modal contracts are now source-guarded: remaining shared delete data-action Url.Action buttons must keep confirm-modal target, id, rowVersion, HTMX target, and swap wiring together; user-address deletes are covered through the parent user editor shell, and the media queue now sends data-rowversion with delete actions.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin HTMX mutation safety is now source-guarded: unit tests enumerate all .cshtml views and fail if any hx-post mutation surface is introduced without @Html.AntiForgeryToken() in the posting Razor view, preserving existing POST contracts while blocking tokenless HTMX mutations.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Razor cleanup contracts are now source-guarded: unit tests enumerate all .cshtml views and fail if raw GET navigation/media attributes (hx-get, href, or src) regress to inline @Url.Action(...), or if operator-facing timestamps regress to fixed ToString("u"); POST mutation and delete-modal data-action contracts remain intentionally outside this GET-navigation guard.
2026-04-24 - Localization readiness tail completed for catalog/CMS/identity WebAdmin chrome: Categories, Pages, Products, and the user edit lockout rail now render remaining operator timestamps through CurrentCulture helpers instead of fixed ToString("u"); WebAdmin view scan is clean for raw ToString("u"), while the remaining datetime-local ISO value is intentionally preserved for HTML input compatibility.
2026-04-24 - WebAdmin raw hx-get Url.Action cleanup completed: final one-off raw GET links across Billing finance/payment editor backs, Inventory stock/reservation/transfer/supplier/warehouse editor backs, Media/Brand/Category/Page/Product form backs, Orders payment/invoice/refund/shipment create-shell backs, CRM lead/opportunity fragment loaders, and Home dashboard refresh cards now use explicit URL helpers; WebAdmin Razor views scan clean with zero raw hx-get Url.Action links, POST mutation/delete contracts remain unchanged, and unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Loyalty navigation cleanup: Loyalty Programs, Accounts, Campaigns, RewardTiers, ScanSessions, Redemptions, account creation, point adjustment, and editor forms now use explicit URL helpers for workspace filters, cross-workspace pivots, create/edit/detail/back links, mobile/provider-review follow-ups, reward-tier handoffs, and account adjustments; the Loyalty view folder is free of raw hx-get Url.Action links while mutation POST contracts remain unchanged, and unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Inventory ledger/stock/warehouse navigation cleanup: Inventory VariantLedger, StockLevels, and Warehouses now use explicit URL helpers for ledger filters, stock-level search/reset/queue chips, create/edit/adjust/reserve/release/return actions, warehouse filters, and stock-level/ledger pivots; the remaining high-count Inventory raw hx-get Url.Action clusters are cleared while pager/query and mutation contracts remain unchanged, and unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Orders return/detail/shipment-grid navigation cleanup: Orders ReturnsQueue, Details, and _ShipmentsGrid now use explicit URL helpers for return filters, refund/shipment queue follow-ups, order operation shells, tax/shipping settings pivots, tab fragment loaders, and shipment refund/remediation actions; the largest remaining Orders raw hx-get Url.Action clusters are removed while status-change and DHL-label POST mutation contracts remain unchanged, and unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Inventory transfer/procurement navigation cleanup: Inventory StockTransfers, PurchaseOrders, and Suppliers now use explicit URL helpers for queue filters, reset/search forms, create/edit actions, stock-level pivots, supplier/purchase-order handoffs, and row drill-ins; the three largest Inventory raw hx-get Url.Action clusters are removed while pager/query contracts remain unchanged, and unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin Users navigation cleanup: Users Index, _UserEditEditorShell, _UserChangeEmailEditorShell, and _UserChangePasswordEditorShell now use explicit URL helpers for lifecycle queues, failed activation/password-reset audits, mobile/loyalty pivots, create/edit/roles/credential-change actions, and return-to-index back links; the Users view folder is clean of raw hx-get Url.Action links while identity mutation POSTs and delete modal actions remain unchanged, and unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin finance/order operations handoff cleanup: Billing, Businesses support/readiness, CRM, Orders, and SiteSettings now route intentional aggregate Refunds, TaxCompliance, Invoices, ShipmentsQueue, and ReturnsQueue pivots through explicit global URL helpers; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin EmailAudits aggregate handoff cleanup: EmailAudits filter/reset self-navigation now routes through an explicit global EmailAudits URL helper, leaving the raw aggregate Users/EmailAudits/Payments HTMX scan clean; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin global handoff hardening: Permission, role, site-settings, and user fleet-level workspaces now use explicit global Support Queue/Mobile Operations URL helpers for intentional aggregate pivots, separating them from tenant-scope regressions in source scans; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin tenant-scope continuation: Businesses/Index row attention badges now open scoped member/location/edit/invitation remediation, and scoped Support Queue, Merchant Readiness, and Mobile Operations preserve businessId through MobileOperations handoffs and filter refresh; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin support summary scope: _SupportQueueSummary now receives the full queue VM and preserves businessId through refresh plus MerchantReadiness, EmailAudits, Payments, and MobileOperations handoffs; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin merchant-readiness playbook scope: MerchantReadiness playbooks now accept optional businessId so scoped SupportQueue/MerchantReadiness workspaces preserve tenant context in approval/setup follow-up buttons while aggregate business lists remain global; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin business playbook scope: business member, invitation, owner-override, and subscription playbook follow-up URLs now carry businessId into MobileOperations, SupportQueue, and MerchantReadiness instead of reopening global remediation boards; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin mobile playbook scope: MobileOperations playbooks now receive businessId so missing-push, business-member-device, and member-lifecycle queue actions preserve tenant scope in table links and buttons; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin mobile support scope: MobileOperations now preserves the current businessId when opening SupportQueue from header, go-live/onboarding rails, onboarding dependency card, and business-member device rows; source guards updated; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - WebAdmin tenant-scoped support/readiness handoffs: setup shell, business forms, owner-override audits, and subscription helper pivots now preserve businessId into SupportQueue/MerchantReadiness for both HTMX and progressive href navigation; unit tests pass (948/948).

2026-04-24 - Tenant scoping update: Support Queue and Merchant Readiness now accept businessId workspace scope, filter summaries, failed-email handoffs, and readiness rows for the selected business, and preserve that scope from member, invitation, location, staff badge, and editor-shell pivots.

2026-04-24 - Tenant scoping update: business member, invitation, setup-preview, staff-access-badge, failed-email, email-audit, merchant-readiness row, and loyalty mobile handoffs now carry businessId into Mobile Operations; fleet-wide Mobile Operations links remain only on aggregate/global admin surfaces.

2026-04-24 - Tenant scoping update: Mobile Operations now accepts and preserves a businessId device filter, so business communication profiles, channel-audit phone-verification rows, and setup mobile/security handoffs open mobile-device triage scoped to the selected or affected business instead of the fleet-wide device queue.

2026-04-24 - Tenant scoping update: business-member pending-activation alerts and non-email channel-audit identity-lifecycle follow-ups now route activation/password-reset remediation to Businesses/Members whenever a business id is available. Global Users queues remain only for aggregate dashboards, mobile-linked identity review, and tenantless account lookup fallbacks.

- 2026-04-24: Support failed-email rows and selected-business Home support/communication cards now keep activation/password-reset member remediation, failed-flow audits, retry/chain follow-up, and channel escalation drill-ins scoped to the affected or selected business; only explicit email/account lookup fallbacks remain global user searches.

- 2026-04-24: Business Setup and Merchant Readiness row-level runtime-execution rails now send pending-activation and locked/password-reset member handoffs to the selected business Members queue, while aggregate readiness cards intentionally remain global for fleet-wide triage.

- 2026-04-24: Business Communications index rows now expose tenant-scoped remediation handoffs for email audits, failed invitation emails, SMS/WhatsApp audits, pending invitations, pending activations, and locked/password-reset members so operators can resolve common delivery and member-support issues directly from the business list.

- 2026-04-24: Business communication profile member-remediation links for pending activation and locked/password-reset support now open the selected business Members queue with the matching support filter, keeping runtime triage tenant-scoped instead of falling back to global Users queues.

- 2026-04-24: Home communication-ops refresh now hydrates BusinessSupport together with CommunicationOps, and selected-business communication drilldowns for retry-blocked, repeated failures, failed flows, action-blocked/escalation, and phone verification now include the selected businessId instead of falling back to global audit queues.

- 2026-04-24: Home business-operations selected-business runtime health now uses selected BusinessSupport failed-email counts and scopes invitation/member plus email/channel remediation links with the selected businessId, preventing global communication failures from leaking into tenant-specific dashboard triage.

- 2026-04-24: Home business-support selected-business snapshot now counts failed invitation, activation, password-reset, and admin-test email audits by selected business through BusinessSupport, and selected failed-email audit links include the selected businessId so fragment refreshes stay scoped.

- 2026-04-24: Failed invitation delivery counts now flow through support and communication summary DTOs into Support Queue, Merchant Readiness, Home communication/support cards, and Business Setup runtime-execution summaries, so top-level readiness no longer hides invitation delivery failures while lower-level communication screens expose them.

- 2026-04-24: Business Communications runtime execution health now counts failed invitation emails alongside activation, password reset, and admin-test failures on both the operations index and per-business communication profile, with direct failed-invitation audit handoffs kept visible in the same action rails.

- 2026-04-24: The Business Communications operations index now exposes failed invitation email audits from both primary runtime/provider action rails, closing the remaining communication-ops gap where operators could open pending invitations but not the matching failed delivery queue directly.

- 2026-04-24: The business communication profile current-flows action now opens business-scoped failed invitation audits with an explicit failed-invitation CTA, so communication-profile triage follows the same delivery-failure path as setup, readiness, and invitation queue surfaces.

- 2026-04-24: Setup and merchant-readiness invitation surfaces now preserve business-scoped failed-invitation audit handoffs, including recipient-level setup preview links and per-business readiness links, so invitation delivery triage stays precise outside the invitation queue as well.

- 2026-04-24: Business invitation rows now deep-link directly to business/email-scoped failed invitation email audits, so resend/revoke triage can inspect delivery failures from the invitation queue itself.
- 2026-04-24: The business invitation form now links creation guidance directly to business-scoped failed invitation email audits, so invitation-side support can inspect delivery failures from the same workflow used to send or adjust invitations.
- 2026-04-24: The business member editor now links member activation and password-reset support actions directly to business-scoped failed email audits, so member-level support can inspect delivery failures without leaving the editor context.
- 2026-04-24: Owner-override audit rows now deep-link directly into the affected business member editor, so governance review can jump from the audit trail to the exact membership record alongside user, support queue, and readiness follow-up.
- 2026-04-24: The refreshable business support summary now links suspended and missing-owner governance cards directly to owner-override audits, so support exception review remains reachable from the fragment dashboard as well as the full support header.
- 2026-04-24: Permission create and edit editors now match the role permissions editor with direct delegated-support permission, business support queue, unconfirmed-user, and locked-user handoffs, so permission catalog work can pivot into access/support remediation without returning to the permissions list.
- 2026-04-24: The role permissions editor now exposes direct delegated-support permission, business support queue, unconfirmed-user, and locked-user handoffs so access remediation remains reachable while role permissions are tuned.
- 2026-04-24: The user roles editor now matches the user edit and credential-change shells with direct unconfirmed, locked, failed-activation, and failed-password-reset handoffs, so role work can pivot into account-state remediation without returning to the users queue.
- 2026-04-24: Users edit, change-email, and change-password editor shells now hand off directly into unconfirmed, locked, inactive, failed-activation, and failed-password-reset lanes so access/support remediation no longer depends on returning to the main users queue first.
- 2026-04-24: Localization readiness now also covers the Billing payment editor timeline, Business StaffAccessBadge timestamps, and remaining CRM customer/invoice/opportunity display dates so those lower-traffic operator surfaces render local-time culture-aware dates instead of invariant strings.

> Scope: `src/Darwin.WebAdmin`, the internal back-office used by staff and administrators.

- `Invitation creation remediation`: `_BusinessInvitationForm` now exposes direct pivots for `Invitations`, `Setup`, `Business Support Queue`, and `Merchant Readiness`, so invitation help does not stop at passive copy.
- `Member assignment remediation`: `_BusinessMemberForm` now exposes direct pivots for `Members`, `Pending Activation`, `Business Support Queue`, and `Merchant Readiness`, so assignment help does not stop at passive copy.
- `Location form remediation`: `_BusinessLocationForm` now exposes direct pivots for `Setup` and `Merchant Readiness`, so location editing does not stop at a save/cancel-only footer.
- `Business creation remediation`: `_BusinessForm` now exposes direct pivots for `Users`, `Business Support Queue`, and `Merchant Readiness` from the initial-owner help block, so business creation does not stop at passive guidance.
- `Business lifecycle remediation`: `_BusinessForm` now exposes direct pivots for `Business Support Queue` and `Merchant Readiness` from the active-state help block, so lifecycle constraints do not stop at passive guidance.
- `Business edit remediation`: `_BusinessForm` now exposes direct pivots for `Business Support Queue` and `Merchant Readiness` from the edit footer, so business edit flows do not stop at structural workspace links alone.
- `Member editor remediation`: `_BusinessMemberEditorShell` now exposes direct pivots for `Members`, `Business Support Queue`, and `Merchant Readiness` from the base edit flow, so member editing does not rely only on header navigation or owner-override branches.
- `Editor footer remediation`: `_BusinessLocationEditorShell` and `_BusinessInvitationEditorShell` now expose footer pivots for their workspace follow-up lanes, so these editor flows do not rely only on header navigation.
- `Staff badge payload remediation`: `StaffAccessBadge` now exposes direct pivots for `Edit member`, `User edit`, `Members`, and `Merchant Readiness` from the payload card, so badge payload review does not stop at explanatory copy plus raw payload.
- `Owner override row remediation`: `OwnerOverrideAudits` now exposes direct pivots for `Business Support Queue` and `Merchant Readiness` from each audit row, so governance event review does not stop at user/member drill-in alone.
- `Subscription invoice row remediation`: `SubscriptionInvoices` now exposes direct pivots for `Business Support Queue` and `Merchant Readiness` from each invoice row, so invoice review does not stop at hosted/pdf/payments actions alone.
- `Subscription invoice empty-state remediation`: `SubscriptionInvoices` now exposes direct pivots for `Subscription`, `Payments`, `Business Support Queue`, and `Merchant Readiness` from its empty state, so zero-row invoice review does not stop at passive copy.
- `Location row remediation`: `Locations` now exposes direct pivots for `Setup` and `Merchant Readiness` from each location row, so location review does not stop at edit/archive actions alone.
- `Invitation row remediation`: `Invitations` now exposes direct pivots for `Business Support Queue` and `Merchant Readiness` from each invitation row, so invitation review does not stop at resend/revoke mutations alone.
- `Member row remediation`: `Members` now exposes direct pivots for `Business Support Queue` and `Merchant Readiness` from each member row, so member review does not stop at edit/user/mobile/loyalty actions and local mutations alone.

## 1. Role of WebAdmin

`Darwin.WebAdmin` is not a secondary side-panel. It is the first operational control center for Darwin.

Its responsibility is to support:

- business creation and setup
- tenant/customer provisioning where applicable
- user, owner, admin, and staff management
- onboarding and activation support
- catalog and CMS management
- payment and shipping visibility
- CRM and support operations
- inventory and procurement operations
- settings and operational configuration
- troubleshooting and admin intervention

This is the most important active delivery surface in the current phase.

## 2. Current Status

- `In Progress`: major module coverage exists and the HTMX-first rewrite is now near operational completion
- `Highest priority`: current team focus is to complete WebAdmin before wider storefront expansion
- `Operational goal`: make day-one SME operations workable from WebAdmin plus supporting backend/mobile flows

## 3. Technology Stack

- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Razor views
- HTMX for server-driven partial interactions
- Bootstrap for layout and components
- minimal JavaScript only where modal orchestration or editor integration still requires it
- ASP.NET Core localization via `IStringLocalizer` and `.resx` resources for shared UI and application validation text, with `SharedResource*.resx` for WebAdmin UI text and `ValidationResource*.resx` in `Darwin.Application` for cross-host validator/business-rule feedback; `SharedResource*.resx` is now the single source of truth for admin UI text, the current migrated application paths no longer rely on obvious raw English `InvalidOperationException`/`DbUpdateConcurrencyException` string literals for their main rule feedback, and site settings now expose a platform-level `AdminTextOverridesJson` layer so wording overrides can be applied without editing source resource files
- WebAdmin localization plumbing now lives under a dedicated `Localization` slice instead of the generic `Infrastructure` bucket; `SharedResource` and `ValidationResource` intentionally stay as root-level marker types because that keeps `Resources/SharedResource*.resx` and `Resources/ValidationResource*.resx` direct and predictable while feature-specific resource families can still be added later if a real bounded-context split emerges, and the current platform-level override contract intentionally uses the shorter `AdminText` wording rather than the older `AdminUiText` phrasing so naming stays aligned with `AdminTextLocalizer`
- the current admin language contract is now also centralized in a dedicated culture catalog instead of repeating `de-DE` / `en-US` defaults across controllers, settings cache, and view models, which makes the bilingual baseline easier to evolve without accidentally splitting platform-culture rules from one another
- admin text resolution now has a clear precedence model: business-scoped `AdminTextOverridesJson` on business surfaces, then platform-wide `AdminTextOverridesJson` from site settings, then `SharedResource*.resx`

HTMX is the preferred mechanism for partial loading and form submission. Alpine.js is not part of the current stack.

## 4. WebAdmin as Operational Control Center

WebAdmin must be treated as the initial command center for:

- creating and provisioning businesses
- assigning owner/admin users
- completing initial setup
- supporting activation and approval workflows
- exposing payment, shipment, communication, and account visibility
- supporting admin troubleshooting for mobile and backend-driven operations

This is especially important because early operational usage is expected to start from `Darwin.Mobile.Business`, which depends on backend/admin setup being correct.

## 5. Module Status Overview

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog/CMS | In Progress | Core CRUD and HTMX patterns exist; products, pages, categories, brands, add-on groups, and media/pages workspaces now have queue-style filters, live summary cards, attachment/context visibility where relevant, HTMX-safe list/search/pager/editor-back flows, and operator playbooks, while add-on attachment flows now also stay inside shell-based search/save/pager workflows; the shared application validation-resource path now also covers key catalog/CMS validation messages such as translation requirements, public-menu URL rules, add-on-group attach/update feedback, media-asset edit guardrails, brand/menu maintenance feedback, product add-on applicability not-found handling, and category/product/page concurrency feedback, while broader operational completeness still needs audit on the last lower-traffic config screens. |
| Business / Tenant Onboarding | In Progress | Business CRUD, owner assignment, member management, location management, invitation management, approval/suspension/reactivation, onboarding checklist visibility, actionable next-step shortcuts, delegated support access, dedicated business subscription support, staff-badge support preview, and business mobile soft-gate policy now exist; the main businesses queue plus support/setup surfaces are now also moving onto the de/en localization baseline, business setup now also exposes a tenant-scoped `AdminTextOverridesJson` field for business-only operator wording overrides layered above the platform baseline, the business communication-defaults lane now also summarizes tenant-owned identity readiness plus direct policy/audit/profile remediation handoffs, the setup workspace itself now surfaces a dedicated go-live remediation rail for lifecycle/tax/communications/subscription follow-up, and Merchant Readiness now mirrors that same go-live control framing with direct tax/communications/payments drill-ins, while tenant/customer provisioning and richer onboarding-state orchestration remain near-term. |
| Orders/Billing | In Progress | Order detail, payments, refunds, invoices, and reconciliation visibility exist, and both the orders list and the detail tabs now have queue-style operational filters for open, payment-issue, fulfillment, refund, and invoice follow-up work; the orders list now exposes quick payment/shipment/invoice actions and is now moving onto the de/en localization baseline, the orders detail shell plus payment/refund/invoice/shipment tab grids are now also moving onto that same bilingual path, the billing payments queue exposes direct invoice/order/customer follow-up actions, the billing payments/refunds entry queues are now also moving onto the same bilingual baseline, and webhook/payment-detail surfaces are now following that same bilingual path, expense rows expose supplier follow-up, financial-account rows deep-link into journal-entry follow-up, financial accounts / journal entries now expose lightweight account-type and recent-or-complex queue filters, lower-traffic order detail grids now also keep pager and editor/config handoff links inside HTMX-safe shells, and phase-1 Stripe/VAT readiness is now surfaced from both Site Settings and billing workspaces, while the tax-compliance remediation rail now also pushes due-soon and draft invoice follow-up directly into CRM invoice subsets instead of relying only on broader payment-issue detours, and the selected-business dashboard operations card now jumps directly into tax-compliance plus overdue, due-soon, and draft invoice lanes, while the dashboard support card now also jumps directly into tax-compliance, payments, and overdue/due-soon invoice lanes; deeper provider reconciliation/dispute depth still needs work. |
| Orders/Billing | In Progress | Order detail, payments, refunds, invoices, and reconciliation visibility exist, and both the orders list and the detail tabs now have queue-style operational filters for open, payment-issue, fulfillment, refund, and invoice follow-up work; the orders list now exposes quick payment/shipment/invoice actions and is now moving onto the de/en localization baseline, the orders detail shell plus payment/refund/invoice/shipment tab grids are now also moving onto that same bilingual path, the billing payments queue exposes direct invoice/order/customer follow-up actions, the billing payments/refunds entry queues are now also moving onto the same bilingual baseline, webhook/payment-detail surfaces are now following that same bilingual path, the payment editor itself is now also moving onto the bilingual path so reconciliation/dispute work does not drop back to English-only editing, and remaining order-billing not-found/linkability failures plus shipment-creation not-found feedback now also route through `ValidationResource*.resx`, while expense rows expose supplier follow-up, financial-account rows deep-link into journal-entry follow-up, financial accounts / journal entries now expose lightweight account-type and recent-or-complex queue filters, lower-traffic order detail grids now also keep pager and editor/config handoff links inside HTMX-safe shells, and phase-1 Stripe/VAT readiness is now surfaced from both Site Settings and billing workspaces, while the tax-compliance remediation rail now also pushes due-soon and draft invoice follow-up directly into CRM invoice subsets instead of relying only on broader payment-issue detours, and the selected-business dashboard operations card now jumps directly into tax-compliance plus overdue, due-soon, and draft invoice lanes, while the dashboard support card now also jumps directly into tax-compliance, payments, and overdue/due-soon invoice lanes; deeper provider reconciliation/dispute depth still needs work. |
| CRM | In Progress | Customers, leads, opportunities, interactions, segments, and invoice workflows exist; customer, lead, opportunity, and invoice queues now expose quick follow-up actions like linked-user review, interaction/segment deep-links, lead conversion, customer/order/payment deep-links, prefilled opportunity creation, common invoice status transitions, explicit B2C/B2B customer tax profiling with VAT ID visibility, locale-source and platform-fallback visibility for customer follow-up, and VAT-aware invoice context with net/tax/gross splits plus live tax-policy visibility, while the main CRM overview/lead/opportunity/invoice workspaces and the remaining invoice-editor order/customer remediation links now stay inside HTMX-safe shell navigation instead of falling back to older full-page routes; CRM overview, customer queue, lead/opportunity/invoice workbenches, the segment queue, and the main customer/lead/opportunity/invoice editor shells are now also moving onto the de/en localization baseline, while deeper reporting and support depth still need improvement. |
| CRM | In Progress | Customers, leads, opportunities, interactions, segments, and invoice workflows exist; customer, lead, opportunity, and invoice queues now expose quick follow-up actions like linked-user review, interaction/segment deep-links, lead conversion, customer/order/payment deep-links, prefilled opportunity creation, common invoice status transitions, explicit B2C/B2B customer tax profiling with VAT ID visibility, locale-source and platform-fallback visibility for customer follow-up, and VAT-aware invoice context with net/tax/gross splits plus live tax-policy visibility, while the main CRM overview/lead/opportunity/invoice workspaces and the remaining invoice-editor order/customer remediation links now stay inside HTMX-safe shell navigation instead of falling back to older full-page routes; CRM overview, customer queue, lead/opportunity/invoice workbenches, the segment queue, the main customer/lead/opportunity/invoice editor shells, several common help/dynamic-form texts, the main customer editor metadata, and CRM engagement/customer-lead/opportunity handler feedback now also move through the shared `resx` localization path, while deeper reporting and support depth still need improvement. |
| Loyalty | In Progress | WebAdmin now covers loyalty programs, reward tiers, member accounts, admin-side account provisioning, manual point adjustments, account suspend/activate, redemption troubleshooting/confirmation, business campaigns, and recent scan-session diagnostics; the admin dashboard now also surfaces loyalty counts and direct follow-up links, and the current-user loyalty-business query now also routes its missing-user guardrail through the shared validation-resource path, so the main near-term gap is deeper mobile diagnostics rather than basic loyalty operations. |
| Inventory/Procurement | In Progress | Warehouses, suppliers, stock, transfers, purchase orders, and ledger views exist, and warehouse, supplier, purchase-order, stock-level, stock-transfer, and ledger screens now have queue-style operational filters or direct troubleshooting links for setup, replenishment, and stock-attention work; supplier rows now deep-link into purchase-order follow-up, warehouse rows deep-link into scoped stock-level review, the same lower-traffic inventory workspaces now also render through HTMX-aware shell helpers with in-shell search/filter/pager/editor flows, manual stock adjustment, reservation, reservation-release, and return-receipt flows are now exposed from stock levels, and the warehouse/stock-level plus supplier/purchase-order/stock-transfer queues, inventory ledger, and the main warehouse/supplier/stock-transfer editor shells are now moving onto the de/en localization baseline, while richer exception and structured receiving workflows still need work. |
| Identity/Admin Support | In Progress | Users, roles, permissions, and core admin identity flows exist; the users workspace now also exposes queue-style lifecycle filters, queue-level confirm-email/password-reset/activate/deactivate support actions, and an explicit inactive-account playbook alongside unconfirmed, locked, inactive, and mobile-linked triage, while the roles/permissions workspaces now also turn summary cards and ops playbooks into direct queue-entry and create-entry rails, but broader invite/activation/support depth still needs audit. |
| Media | In Progress | Media library exists and now supports content-ops queue filters plus direct file-open, missing-alt, and missing-title follow-up actions, along with summary cards and media-ops playbooks; deeper reference tracking and purge workflows are still later work. |
| Settings | In Progress | Global site settings exist and business onboarding now has a dedicated setup workspace; business-app legal/billing handoff URLs plus phase-1 Stripe/DHL provider settings and VAT/invoice-issuer defaults are now manageable from site settings, and site settings now also drive a real `de-DE` / `en-US` localization baseline for WebAdmin with supported-cultures governance, culture switching, shared-resource-backed display metadata for the main settings form, a platform-level `AdminTextOverridesJson` override surface for wording changes without source edits, an operational readiness overview for localization/communications/commerce/security, fragment-aware focus persistence for deep links and save loops, a flow-by-flow communication-policy preview matrix with direct communications/provider-review handoffs, and a shipping execution rail with direct carrier-review, missing-service, overdue-tracking, awaiting-handoff, and shipping-method remediation handoffs; that validator path now also covers orders, loyalty, inventory, cart/checkout, cart-summary pricing/tax/currency guardrails, storefront checkout/payment confirmation, add-on pricing, pricing, shipping, SEO uniqueness, and selected catalog/CMS/business/onboarding business-rule feedback, but full tenant-aware settings architecture still needs domain and UI expansion. |
| Mobile Operations | In Progress | WebAdmin now includes a dedicated mobile-operations workspace for JWT/mobile bootstrap, onboarding/support dependency counts, communication readiness, device-fleet diagnostics, app-version visibility, device-level filtering for stale installs, missing push tokens, notification-disabled devices, and business-member devices, plus lightweight remediation actions like push-token clearing and device deactivation; the workspace now also opens with a go-live remediation rail for bootstrap, onboarding/support dependencies, communication transport readiness, and device-fleet attention, adds a dedicated device-remediation lane plus row-level subset/support handoffs for missing-push, notifications-disabled, and business-member devices, turns the playbook table into direct queue/follow-up handoffs across mobile, loyalty, communications, support, and settings lanes, and now also aligns the dashboard mobile card with stale/missing-push subset routing instead of only a generic diagnostics entry, while staying inside HTMX-safe navigation and remediation flows, so future work is mainly deeper telemetry or richer remediation rather than basic visibility. |
| Communication Management | In Progress | Business communications now have HTMX-safe workspace/profile/audit flows, template and retry visibility matrices, flow-specific playbooks, safe test-email/SMS/WhatsApp reruns, recipient-aware handoffs into invitation/user/business support surfaces, delivery age/latency/severity context, controlled generic retry for failed or pending invitation/activation/password-reset rows after safe target resolution, policy-aware retry state (`ready`, `cooldown`, `rate-limited`, blocked reason, retry-available timing, recent-chain volume), first-class `repeated failures` / `prior success context` triage, exact-chain exploration for one recipient/flow/business path, row-level email-audit handoffs into retry-blocked, chain-follow-up, repeated-failure, business-support, business-detail, and policy lanes, row-level channel-audit handoffs into action-blocked, chain-follow-up, repeated-failure, provider-review, escalation, business-support, business-detail, and policy lanes, a business-scoped communication profile summary that now exposes retry-blocked, heavy-chain, action-blocked, and escalation-candidate drill-ins into the matching audit subsets, a top-level communications workspace summary that now exposes the same blocked and escalation subsets before operators drop into the audit queues, and a communications-policy settings rail that now deep-links directly into retry-blocked, action-blocked, escalation-candidate, provider-review, and verification-policy lanes, while the dashboard communication card now also jumps directly into retry-blocked, action-blocked, and escalation-candidate lanes, canonical phone-verification support over SMS or WhatsApp with customizable text templates, a persisted SMS/WhatsApp audit baseline for live verification and operator diagnostics, live non-email message-family views in the workspace/profile and exact-chain surfaces that expose effective template text, rendered sample preview, supported tokens, target path, policy notes, safe-usage guidance, rollout boundaries, direct settings handoff, and safe family-level diagnostic reruns, plus `Heavy Chains`, provider-lane triage, provider recovery state, and provider-guided action depth for noisy SMS/WhatsApp lanes; email-audit and non-email-audit detail surfaces are now also moving onto the de/en localization baseline, while deeper delivery-log infrastructure, broader outbox/provider-event modeling, and richer template CRUD remain near-term. |
| Shipping Operations | In Progress | Generic order shipment visibility exists, and WebAdmin now exposes both shipping-method configuration with queue filters/editable rate tiers and a cross-order shipment queue for packing, tracking, carrier-review, and return-follow-up work; shipping-method maintenance, shipment creation, and part of the related not-found/concurrency feedback now also move through the shared validation-resource path, the shipping-method form itself now carries inline remediation tiles plus direct handoffs into shipment triage and shipping settings, the shipping-settings section now exposes direct execution handoffs into shipment and method subsets, shipment rows themselves now deep-link into queue-level and config-level remediation lanes, and return rows now also deep-link into shipment, settings, and DHL-method follow-up lanes alongside refund actions, while deeper DHL carrier lifecycle and full RMA completion still remain near-term. |

## 6. HTMX Conventions

HTMX is the default pattern for server-driven interaction.

### Use `hx-get` for

- fragment loading
- tab/section refresh
- partial list updates
- detail sub-panels

### Use `hx-post` for

- form submissions
- modal commands
- partial section replacement
- operator workflows where the page should not fully reload

### Keep server responses authoritative

- validation messages stay server-rendered
- alerts stay server-rendered
- list rows and partial grids stay server-rendered
- concurrency and permission results come back from controller/application responses, not client guesses

### Keep anti-forgery and Bootstrap hooks centralized

- HTMX requests must carry ASP.NET Core anti-forgery
- swapped fragments must reinitialize Bootstrap affordances
- do not scatter one-off client-side refresh code when the layout can coordinate it centrally

### Standard interaction pattern

- queue/list screens should render as a `workspace shell`
- create/edit/assignment flows should render as an `editor shell`
- GET entry points should be HTMX-aware, not only POST validation rerenders
- successful POSTs should prefer `RedirectOrHtmx`-style return paths so operators stay inside the current workflow whenever possible

## 7. Business Onboarding Workflows

Business onboarding is a near-term operational requirement and should be documented as a real workflow, not only entity CRUD.

Target workflow:

1. create business
2. provision tenant/customer context as needed
3. assign owner/admin user
4. trigger invitation or activation
5. complete initial defaults and setup
6. move through activation/approval states
7. support suspension/deactivation/reactivation

### Current state

- `In Progress`: business creation, owner assignment, member management, location management, and invitation/resend/revoke now exist in WebAdmin
- `Completed`: business onboarding shells now surface direct next actions for missing owner, location, invitation, and profile-completion steps instead of only passive checklist warnings
- `Completed`: the business list now supports operational-status and needs-attention filtering, making approval and setup queues easier for operators to process
- `Completed`: a dedicated business setup workspace now groups profile, localization/defaults, onboarding shortcuts, and phase-1 settings dependencies instead of forcing operators to infer setup from scattered screens
- `Completed`: the setup workspace now also surfaces inline previews of members needing activation/lockout support and open invitations, so operators can troubleshoot onboarding from one place
- `Completed foundation`: business setup now persists business-level branding, localization defaults, time zone, and phase-1 communication toggles/defaults instead of treating all setup as a thin wrapper around global settings
- `Completed foundation`: the setup workspace now also shows the current business subscription snapshot so support/admin can confirm plan/provider/renewal context without leaving WebAdmin
- `Completed foundation`: WebAdmin now also has a dedicated business-subscription workspace with current plan state, active-plan readiness, external management-website handoff visibility, and FullAdmin cancel-at-period-end control
- `Completed foundation`: the same subscription workspace now also surfaces provider invoice history with queue-style triage for open/paid/draft/uncollectible cases, hosted/PDF visibility, and direct payment follow-up links so finance support is not trapped in Stripe or external billing pages
- `Completed foundation`: the same subscription invoice workspace now also supports `Overdue` and `PDF Missing` triage plus a direct refund-queue handoff, so subscription billing support can separate collection follow-up from provider-document gaps inside WebAdmin
- `Completed foundation`: the business subscription workspace and its invoice queue now also support HTMX-driven load, filtering, and cancel-at-period-end update paths, so subscription support no longer falls back to older full-page refresh behavior
- `Completed foundation`: the same subscription invoice queue now also supports HTMX-driven quick triage subsets for open, overdue, PDF-missing, Stripe, and uncollectible invoice cases, so monthly billing support can jump directly into the right subset without rebuilding filters manually
- `Completed foundation`: the main business-subscription workspace now also exposes direct triage handoff actions for open, overdue, PDF-missing, and uncollectible invoice queues, so monthly billing support can jump from summary signals into the right follow-up queue immediately
- `Completed foundation`: navigation between the main business-subscription workspace and the subscription-invoice queue now also stays inside the HTMX workflow, so billing triage can move between summary and invoice-detail queues without dropping back to older full-page navigation
- `Completed foundation`: business-subscription and subscription-invoice workspaces now also hand off internally to business edit/setup, payments, refunds, and payment/site-setting review through HTMX-aware routes, so monthly-contract support no longer mixes fragment-driven billing triage with older full-page admin detours
- `Completed foundation`: the payments workspace now also opens record/edit payment flows through HTMX-aware entry paths, and the payment editor now returns through the same fragment workflow, so finance support no longer drops back to older full-page payment-maintenance routes
- `Completed foundation`: subscription-plan handoff links are now business-aware and plan-aware, so admins can start or upgrade a business against a specific monthly plan from WebAdmin instead of only opening a generic external billing website
- `Completed`: invitation acceptance is now available in `Darwin.Mobile.Business` as the current phase-1 business-user onboarding path
- `Decision made`: phase-1 owner onboarding supports both assigning an existing platform user and invitation-first owner creation
- `Completed foundation`: invitation issue/resend emails can now carry both the manual token and a configurable magic-link path
- `Planned / Near-term`: harden the current config-driven magic-link path into fully verified app-link handling if production mobile onboarding needs it
- `Completed`: approval, suspension, and reactivation actions now exist in WebAdmin, together with a readiness checklist for owner, primary location, contact email, and legal-name completion
- `Completed`: approval decisions now have operational impact because `Darwin.Mobile.Business` uses a phase-1 soft gate against the business access-state API
- `Completed foundation`: delegated business-support operators can now access business listing, member-support, and invitation workflows through a dedicated permission path, while business lifecycle and ownership-sensitive actions remain FullAdmin-only
- `Completed foundation`: dashboard, user-role assignment, and permission listing screens now call out the delegated business-support role/permission explicitly, making support access assignment operationally discoverable
- `Completed foundation`: the roles and permissions workspaces now also expose queue-style filters, live summary cards, and small ops playbooks for system/custom/delegated-support review, reducing access-governance cleanup to less than a flat list scan
- `Completed foundation`: the admin dashboard now exposes a business-support queue with attention, approval, invitation, activation, and lockout counts, and the business member/invitation screens now support queue-oriented filters so support operators can jump directly into pending-activation or open-invitation work
- `Completed foundation`: the businesses index now includes quick queue shortcuts for needs-attention, pending-approval, and suspended businesses, which cuts down operator filter setup during onboarding/support review
- `Completed foundation`: the dashboard communication-operations card and business-support queue card are now HTMX-refreshable partials, so operators can refresh live summaries without reloading the full admin dashboard
- `Completed foundation`: WebAdmin now also includes a dedicated `Business Support Queue` workspace that combines attention businesses with recent failed invitation/activation/password-reset emails, reducing page-hopping during onboarding and support triage
- `Completed foundation`: that support queue is now broken into HTMX-refreshable summary, attention-business, and failed-email fragments, so operators can refresh live triage data without a full page reload
- `Completed foundation`: WebAdmin now also exposes a dedicated `Merchant Readiness` workspace that combines attention businesses, setup gaps, lifecycle state, and subscription/billing handoffs, so merchant operations can triage onboarding-to-go-live readiness from one queue instead of stitching together support, setup, and subscription screens manually
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` workspace now also hands off directly into locations, business communication profile, and business-scoped payments, so merchant triage can move from setup/subscription readiness into fulfillment, communication, and billing follow-up without reopening the broader business workspace first
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Merchant Readiness` workspace now also hands off directly into subscription-invoice triage and global tax-compliance review, so merchant follow-up can move from readiness into billing-collection and compliance lanes without reopening separate admin entry points first
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Merchant Readiness` workspace now also hands off directly into business edit and invitation remediation, so merchant ops can move from readiness triage into profile cleanup and onboarding-follow-up without reopening the broader business queue first
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Merchant Readiness` workspace now also hands off directly into owner-override audits and support-queue escalation, so merchant governance follow-up and support routing can start from the readiness queue instead of a separate business workspace detour
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` playbooks are now actionable handoffs instead of passive guidance rows, so approval, setup, and billing operators can jump from the playbook table directly into the exact queue or remediation lane they need
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` summary cards are now actionable queue handoffs rather than read-only counts, so operators can jump from top-level merchant signals straight into business/support triage without first scanning the readiness grid
- `Completed foundation`: those `Merchant Readiness` summary handoffs now also open the correct merchant subsets for pending-approval and suspended businesses instead of only generic queue entry points, so top-level merchant triage is more precise
- `Completed foundation`: the business subscription workspace now also turns its billing playbooks into direct queue and remediation handoffs for site-settings setup, invoice review, payments, and support escalation, so subscription follow-up no longer depends on passive guidance rows.
- `Completed foundation`: the business-members workspace now also exposes member-ops summary cards plus direct playbook handoffs for pending activation, locked accounts, and owner-coverage gaps, so merchant support can start member remediation from top-level signals instead of a plain table and inline warnings.
- `Completed foundation`: the business-invitations workspace now also exposes invitation-ops summary cards plus direct playbook handoffs for open, pending, and expired invite lanes, so onboarding follow-up can start from top-level signals instead of a plain invitation table.
- `Completed foundation`: the owner-override audit workspace now also exposes governance playbooks plus direct drill-ins into affected users and the business members lane, so last-owner override review is no longer a passive audit log.
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` row signals for pending invites, missing owner, and missing primary location now also hand off directly into invitation/member/location remediation, so merchant follow-up can start from the flagged signal itself instead of only from the row action cluster
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Merchant Readiness` row signals for missing contact email, missing legal name, and no active subscription now also hand off directly into profile/subscription remediation, so merchant profile and commercial gaps can be worked from the flagged signal itself
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` subscription cell now also turns live plan/status, cancel-at-period-end, and current-period-end signals into direct subscription or invoice-lane handoffs, so commercial follow-up can start from the flagged subscription signal itself instead of only from the generic row action cluster
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` status and setup cells now also turn pending-approval, suspended, active, and setup-missing signals into direct queue or setup-lane handoffs, so lifecycle and readiness remediation can start from the flagged signal itself instead of only from summary cards or the generic row action cluster
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` row action cluster now also hands off directly into business-scoped refunds and financial accounts, so merchant billing follow-up can move from readiness into refund or accounting lanes without detouring through the broader billing workspace first
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Merchant Readiness` row action cluster now also hands off directly into business-scoped expenses and journal entries, so merchant finance follow-up can move from readiness into accounting-detail lanes without detouring through broader billing navigation first
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` business identity block now also hands off directly into business profile editing, so merchant name and legal-name cleanup can start from the row header itself instead of only from the action cluster
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` row action cluster now also hands off directly into business-scoped email audits and SMS/WhatsApp audits, so merchant communication follow-up can move from readiness into live audit lanes without detouring through the broader communications workspace first
- `Completed foundation`: the `Merchant Readiness` row action cluster now also hands off directly into `Tax Compliance`, so merchant commercial follow-up can jump from a flagged tenant straight into the compliance workspace instead of relying only on the page-level global header action
- `Completed foundation`: the business queue now supports a dedicated `MissingOwner` readiness subset, and the `Merchant Readiness` summary cards for missing-owner, pending-activation, and locked-member signals now jump into that precise business or user lane instead of the broad support queue
- `Completed foundation`: the business queue now also supports dedicated readiness subsets for missing primary location, missing contact email, missing legal name, and pending invites, and the queue's own attention labels now hand off into those precise subsets instead of staying read-only merchant warnings
- `Completed foundation`: `Merchant Readiness` now also surfaces summary cards for missing primary location, missing contact email, missing legal name, and pending invites, so those readiness gaps can be triaged from top-level merchant summaries instead of only from the grid or the broader business queue
- `Completed foundation`: the main `Businesses` workspace now also surfaces top-level readiness summary cards for attention, approval, suspension, missing owner, missing primary location, and pending invites, so merchant triage no longer depends only on filter chips plus table scanning
- `Completed foundation`: the main `Businesses` workspace now also surfaces top-level profile-gap summary cards for missing contact email and missing legal name, so merchant profile cleanup can start from workspace summaries instead of only from readiness chips and table labels
- `Completed foundation`: the main `Businesses` workspace now also surfaces top-level member-account summary cards for pending activation and locked members, so merchant-linked identity remediation can start from the business entry workspace instead of only from `Merchant Readiness` or separate user queues
- `Completed foundation`: those same `Businesses` summary cards now also expose direct remediation pivots into merchant readiness, failed invitation/activation/password-reset audits, payments, and mobile operations instead of staying queue-only, so top-level merchant triage can jump straight from summary signals into the next operational lane
- `Completed foundation`: the main `Businesses` workspace now also exposes the approval/setup/billing playbook table with direct queue and follow-up handoffs, so the primary merchant queue is no longer summary-and-grid only when operators need a structured remediation starting point
- `Completed foundation`: the `Business Support Queue` now also exposes the approval/setup/billing playbook table with direct queue and follow-up handoffs, so support operators have the same structured merchant-remediation entry points without bouncing out to other business workspaces first
- `Completed foundation`: the business-locations workspace now also turns its summary cards and location-readiness playbooks into direct filtered queue handoffs, so location triage no longer depends on scanning the full list or reading passive guidance text before acting
- `Completed foundation`: the business subscription-invoices workspace now also turns its summary cards and billing playbooks into direct filtered invoice-queue handoffs, so collections and document-hygiene follow-up can start from the signal itself instead of static guidance text
- `Completed foundation`: business rows in the main `Businesses` workspace now also hand off directly into business-scoped communications and payments, so merchant follow-up from the main queue no longer depends on detouring through `Merchant Readiness` just to reach those operational lanes
- `Completed foundation`: business rows in the main `Businesses` workspace now also hand off directly into subscription invoices, email audits, SMS/WhatsApp audits, refunds, and owner-override audits, so the main merchant queue is much closer to the deeper triage surface previously available only from `Merchant Readiness`
- `Completed foundation`: business rows in the main `Businesses` workspace now also hand off directly into financial accounts, expenses, journal entries, and tax compliance, so the main merchant queue now reaches the deeper finance/compliance lanes instead of leaving that depth exclusive to `Merchant Readiness`
- `Completed foundation`: the main `Businesses` workspace now also makes business identity, status, owner counts, member counts, and location counts directly actionable, so operators can start profile, lifecycle, membership, and location remediation from the core row cells instead of only from the action cluster
- `Completed foundation`: the main `Businesses` workspace and `Merchant Readiness` now also surface a dedicated `ApprovedInactive` subset with actionable summary cards and status badges, so approved-but-inactive merchants no longer collapse into generic `active` or broad attention states during merchant triage
- `Completed foundation`: the `Business Support Queue` now also surfaces dedicated merchant-readiness cards for approved-inactive, missing-location, missing-contact, and missing-legal-name gaps, and its attention rows now turn status and signal labels into direct remediation handoffs instead of leaving support triage broad and mostly read-only
- `Completed foundation`: the failed-email lane inside `Business Support Queue` now also exposes business-scoped edit, communication-profile, invitation/member, and unconfirmed-user handoffs directly from each failure row, so merchant communication remediation no longer depends on detouring through generic audit searches before reaching the operational lane
- `Completed foundation`: the same failed-email lane now also turns recipient addresses into direct user lookups and gives `PasswordReset` failures first-class `Users` and `Locked users` handoffs, so account-recovery triage no longer stops at the audit row when the next step is user-state investigation
- `Completed foundation`: the `Business Support Queue` header now also exposes direct shortcuts into failed invitation, activation, and password-reset email lanes, so support operators can jump from the queue entry workspace straight into the right transactional failure slice without first opening the broad failed-email log
- `Completed foundation`: the attention rows inside `Business Support Queue` now also hand off directly into business edit, locations, communication profile, and payments, so support triage no longer stalls at setup/member/invitation-only actions when the merchant issue actually lives in profile, fulfillment footprint, communications, or billing lanes
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Business Support Queue` attention rows now also hand off directly into subscription, subscription invoices, email audits, SMS/WhatsApp audits, and tax compliance, so support triage can move from an attention merchant straight into the deeper commercial, communications, and compliance lanes instead of detouring through other merchant workspaces first
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Business Support Queue` attention rows now also hand off directly into refunds, financial accounts, expenses, journal entries, and owner-override audits, so support triage now reaches the deeper finance and governance lanes that were previously easier to reach only from `Businesses` or `Merchant Readiness`
- `Completed foundation`: the main `Business Support Queue` links for queue slices, failed-email slices, attention rows, and audit/business drill-ins now consistently preserve HTMX history, so support operators can move across merchant remediation lanes without dropping into fragment dead-ends on back/forward navigation
- `Completed foundation`: the `Business Support Queue` summary now also promotes missing-owner, pending-invite, and locked-member signals into dedicated cards instead of leaving them only in the bottom inline summary, so top-level support triage can start from those operator-relevant counts without scanning mixed text lines
- `Completed foundation`: business-linked failed-email rows inside `Business Support Queue` now also hand off directly into business edit and payments, so support operators can move from a communication failure into profile or billing remediation without first detouring through a separate merchant queue
- `Completed foundation`: the same business-linked failed-email rows now also hand off directly into subscription, subscription invoices, and tax compliance, so merchant communication failures can move straight into commercial and compliance remediation without leaving the support workspace first
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Business Support Queue` summary now also promotes suspended businesses into a dedicated card instead of leaving suspension triage only in the bottom inline summary, so lifecycle-related merchant support can start from a top-level card like the other high-signal support lanes
- `Completed foundation`: the `Business Support Queue` summary cards for pending activation, pending invites, and locked members now also expose secondary remediation links into mobile operations and the matching failed-email slices, so support operators can move from a count card into the likely next operational lane without dropping to the inline summary
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Business Support Queue` summary cards for approved-inactive and suspended businesses now also expose secondary handoffs into payments and failed-email triage, so lifecycle-related merchant support can move from a top-level count straight into the likely next operational lane instead of stopping at a broad queue entry
- `Completed foundation`: the `Business Support Queue` summary cards for missing primary location, missing contact email, and missing legal name now also expose direct remediation-oriented secondary links, so readiness and profile cleanup can start from the count card instead of only from the broad business subset
- `Completed foundation`: the `Business Support Queue` header now also exposes direct shortcuts for approved-inactive, missing-owner, and pending-invite merchant subsets, so support operators can jump into those high-signal merchant slices from the queue entry workspace without first stepping through summary cards
- `Completed foundation`: the same `Business Support Queue` header now also exposes direct shortcuts for missing-primary-location, missing-contact-email, and missing-legal-name merchant subsets, so readiness and profile cleanup slices can be opened from the support entry workspace without first dropping into the summary grid
  - `Completed foundation`: business create/edit, location create/edit, member create/edit, and invitation-create flows now all render through HTMX-aware shell helpers on initial load and validation rerender, so the core onboarding workspace stays aligned with the newer server-rendered + HTMX admin interaction model
- `Completed foundation`: the business setup and business editor shells now also keep their main onboarding, subscription, payments, communications, and site-settings shortcuts inside HTMX-driven navigation paths, so operators no longer bounce between fragment workflows and older full-page admin detours during setup support
- `Completed foundation`: the business members, invitations, and locations workspaces now also keep their main search, triage, edit, invitation-support, lock/reset/activation, and back-navigation flows inside HTMX-driven shells, so subscriber onboarding/support work can stay in one server-rendered workflow instead of bouncing through older full-page routes
- `Completed foundation`: the core business onboarding forms now also return through HTMX-aware cancel/back paths for business, member, location, and invitation editing, so the final maintenance steps inside subscriber onboarding no longer drop back to legacy full-page routes
- `Completed foundation`: the remaining owner-override audit, staff-badge preview, and setup-preview handoffs now also stay inside HTMX-driven shells, so business support can move between setup diagnostics and member/invitation remediation without dropping back to older full-page navigation
- `Completed foundation`: the businesses index and business support queue now also keep their main queue subsets, search/reset, and cross-workspace support handoffs inside HTMX-driven shells, so onboarding/support operators can triage subscriber issues without dropping back to older full-page navigation
- `Completed foundation`: the businesses index and support queue now also keep business-list triage, support-queue summaries, and failed-email remediation handoffs inside HTMX shells, reducing one of the last high-value onboarding/support detours in the subscriber workflow
- `Planned / Near-term`: explicit onboarding state machine, richer setup workspace UX, and tenant/customer provisioning still need completion

## 8. Authentication-Related Admin Support

WebAdmin should support or coordinate:

- invite user
- resend activation email
- forgot-password assistance
- reset-password initiation/support
- lock/unlock account
- role assignment
- audit visibility

### Current state

- `In Progress`: user, role, permission, password, and email-change admin tooling exists
- `In Progress`: invite issuance/reissue/revoke now exists for business onboarding
- `Completed`: WebAdmin now supports admin-triggered password reset email, lock/unlock, email-confirm override, and activation-email resend from the user edit workflow
- `Completed`: the same activation/reset/lock/unlock support actions are now available directly inside the business-member workspace, which removes a major operator detour during onboarding troubleshooting
- `Completed foundation`: the users queue now also supports in-place activation, lock, and unlock actions from list rows, so common identity-support triage no longer has to leave the HTMX workspace to complete routine account-state changes
- `Completed foundation`: user-role assignment now also supports HTMX-aware entry and return paths from both the users queue and the user editor, so access-governance changes can stay inside the newer server-rendered workflow instead of detouring through separate full-page navigation
- `Completed foundation`: the user-role editor now also returns to the user editor through an HTMX-aware back path, so role-assignment follow-up no longer drops back to a legacy full-page route when launched from account maintenance
- `Completed foundation`: the remaining loyalty campaign queue entry/edit paths now also stay inside the HTMX workspace shell, reducing one of the last plain-link detours in the loyalty priority area
- `Completed foundation`: users queue and user-editor navigation now also stay inside HTMX-aware shells for create, edit, change-email, change-password, and back-navigation paths, so identity support no longer mixes fragment-driven triage with older full-page account-maintenance routes
- `Completed foundation`: the same business-member workspace now also exposes staff access badge preview/refresh, so support can mirror the rotating QR badge used in `Darwin.Mobile.Business`
- `Completed foundation`: selective delegation is now enforced in both controller authorization and view affordances, so support operators can work with invitations and member support without inheriting approval, archive, location, or owner-management powers
- `Completed foundation`: user create/edit, change-email, change-password, role-assignment, role create/edit, and permission create/edit flows now all render through HTMX-aware shell helpers on initial load as well as validation rerender, so the access-management workspace stays aligned with the newer server-rendered + HTMX admin interaction model
- `Completed foundation`: the users list workspace now also supports HTMX-aware search, filter, page-size changes, and lifecycle subset navigation, so identity triage no longer falls back to older full-page list refreshes
- `Completed foundation`: the roles and permissions list workspaces now also support HTMX-aware search, filter, and page-size changes, so access-governance triage stays aligned with the newer Darwin WebAdmin server-rendered + HTMX interaction model
- `Completed foundation`: the roles and permissions queues now also open create/edit and permission-maintenance flows through HTMX-aware entry paths, and their back navigation stays inside the same server-rendered workflow instead of bouncing through older full-page routes
- `Completed foundation`: role-permission assignment now also has an HTMX-safe editor shell, so permission-binding updates no longer depend only on the older encoded full-page editor
- `Completed`: the business-member edit flow now supports a controlled `FullAdmin` override for the "last active owner" rule, with mandatory reason capture, explicit danger-state UI, and persisted audit records
- `Completed`: owner-override audit history is now visible inside the business workspace, so sensitive ownership exceptions are reviewable without querying the database directly
- `Completed foundation`: the platform now has public confirm-email token endpoints, so admin activation support is no longer only a placeholder
- `Planned / Near-term`: decide when activation/email-confirm must become an enforced sign-in prerequisite rather than a supported-but-nonblocking lifecycle step

## 9. Site and System Settings Architecture

Settings are a platform concern, not one crowded page.

### Required design direction

Settings should be grouped and scalable. At minimum, the information architecture should support:

- General
- Business Profile
- Localization
- Branding
- Payments
- Shipping
- Notifications / Communications
- Users & Roles
- Security
- Integrations
- Tax / Invoicing
- Advanced / Feature Flags

### UI/UX guidance

Settings UI must be:

- scalable
- discoverable
- tenant-aware
- permission-aware
- easy for operators to navigate
- future-safe as categories expand

### Current state

- `Partial`: a basic settings UI exists
- `Completed foundation`: the global site settings screen is now grouped into operational categories and exposes JWT/security, mobile bootstrap, and soft-delete retention controls instead of hiding those fields behind DTO-only configuration
- `Completed foundation`: business setup now has its own grouped workspace, persists business-level branding/localization/time-zone/communication defaults, and makes the remaining global phase-1 dependencies explicit
- `Completed foundation`: the business setup workspace now also shows communication readiness against global SMTP/SMS/WhatsApp/admin-alert routing, which gives operators immediate visibility into whether saved business preferences can actually be delivered
- `Completed foundation`: the admin dashboard now also exposes a communication-operations snapshot, making global transport readiness and business-level sender/support-email gaps visible before full Communication Core template/log UIs are built
- `Completed foundation`: site settings now also surface business-app legal and billing handoff URLs such as management website, impressum, privacy, business terms, and account deletion, and mobile operations shows whether those handoffs are configured
- `Completed foundation`: site settings now also expose phase-1 Stripe payment credentials/webhook identity and DHL carrier credentials/default shipper identity directly in the admin UI, instead of leaving those settings implicit or config-file-only
- `Completed foundation`: the site-settings ownership matrix and the business-setup ownership workspace now both include HTMX-safe operator handoffs into business support, communication ops, payment ops, shipment ops, and the relevant global fragments, so the platform-vs-tenant split is actionable instead of merely documented
- `Completed foundation`: the localization section in site settings and the localization defaults block in business setup now both explain fallback-vs-tenant ownership and link directly into business and CRM locale review surfaces, so operators can distinguish platform fallback changes from tenant-only overrides before true multilingual infrastructure lands
- `Completed foundation`: CRM invoice review, invoice editing, and order tax snapshots now also surface archive-readiness and e-invoice-baseline indicators derived from VAT and issuer identity completeness, so compliance-adjacent troubleshooting no longer stops at VAT/net-tax-gross visibility alone
- Completed foundation: the CRM invoices workspace now also opens with a remediation rail plus real Draft, DueSoon, Overdue, MissingVatId, and Refunded queue filters wired through the query/controller path, so operators can jump from invoice signals into payments, customer, opportunity, and tax follow-up lanes without rebuilding the same search state manually.
- Completed foundation: the CRM customers workspace now also opens with a remediation rail for segmentation debt, VAT gaps, locale fallback, and invoice follow-up, and customer rows now deep-link straight into invoice review and tax-settings remediation, so customer triage can move into CRM invoice and localization/tax lanes without detouring through the editor first.
- Completed foundation: the CRM customer editor now also opens with a remediation rail for locale fallback, VAT-gap escalation, segmentation debt, and invoice/opportunity follow-up, so the customer queue and editor no longer drift when operators move from triage into detailed customer maintenance.
- Completed foundation: the order-detail invoice tab now also opens with a remediation rail for outstanding balance, paid coverage, VAT gaps, and refunded invoices, so order-side finance/support work can jump directly into payments, tax compliance, CRM invoice review, and refunds without leaving the order shell first.
- Completed foundation: the order-detail payments tab now also opens with a remediation rail for failed captures, refunded payments, unlinked invoices, and provider-reference follow-up, so payment-side anomalies can jump directly into add-payment, invoice creation/review, refunds, billing payments, and webhook investigation without leaving the order shell first.
- Completed foundation: the order-detail refunds tab now also opens with a remediation rail for pending refunds, completed refunds, returned-shipment follow-up, and provider-reference gaps, so the refund side of order support can jump directly into refunds, payments, shipment review, and return-refund initiation without leaving the order shell first.
- Completed foundation: the order-detail shipments tab now also opens with a remediation rail for awaiting-handoff, tracking-overdue, carrier-review, and return-follow-up cases, so fulfillment-side issues can jump directly into shipment creation, shipping settings, carrier method review, refunds, and return-refund follow-up without leaving the order shell first.
- Completed foundation: the returns queue now also opens with a remediation rail for returned shipments, return-follow-up, carrier-review, and refund-readiness gaps, so the global returns workspace can jump directly into shipments, refunds, and return-refund initiation instead of relying only on the row-level action cluster.
- Completed foundation: the shipments queue now also opens with a remediation rail for awaiting-handoff, tracking-overdue, carrier-review, and return-follow-up cases, so the global fulfillment queue can jump directly into orders, shipping settings, shipping methods, and the returns queue instead of relying only on summary cards and row-level actions.
- Completed foundation: the main orders queue now also opens with a remediation rail for open-order volume, payment issues, fulfillment attention, and invoice/refund follow-up, so operators can jump directly into shipment, return, billing, and CRM queues before dropping into row-level actions.
- Completed foundation: the order detail shell now also opens with a cross-tab remediation rail for payment, shipment, refund, and invoice attention, so operators can jump directly into the relevant tab or global billing/fulfillment queues before hunting through the lower detail workspace.
- Completed foundation: the shipping-method workspace now also opens with a remediation rail for missing rates, DHL methods, inactive configuration, and global/multi-rate review, so fulfillment configuration can jump directly into shipment ops, shipping settings, and method creation instead of relying only on filters and playbooks.
- Completed foundation: the shipping-method editor shell now also opens with a remediation rail for missing-rate cleanup, DHL configuration review, and queue/workspace return paths, so shipping configuration edit flows can jump directly into shipment ops and shipping settings instead of becoming an isolated form detour.
- Completed foundation: the tax-compliance workspace now also opens with a remediation rail for VAT-gap customers, VAT-gap invoices, overdue invoice follow-up, and archive/e-invoice readiness, so compliance triage can jump directly into CRM, orders, billing payments, and tax settings instead of relying only on readiness cards and review tables.
- Completed foundation: the CRM invoice editor now also opens with a remediation rail for VAT-gap cleanup, archive/e-invoice readiness, and balance/payment follow-up, so invoice maintenance can jump directly into tax compliance, customer cleanup, tax settings, and payment review instead of depending only on the lower policy/follow-up blocks.
- Completed foundation: the billing payment editor form now also opens with a remediation rail for missing provider references, reconciliation, dispute follow-up, and webhook/tax handoff, so payment maintenance can jump directly into the right billing queue instead of depending only on the lower reconciliation snapshot and audit tables.
- `Completed foundation`: those compliance snapshots now also hand off directly into tax settings, issuer-data cleanup, invoice review, and customer VAT-profile follow-up, so phase-1 tax/compliance support can move from readiness visibility into operational remediation without pretending a full e-invoice workflow exists
- `Completed foundation`: billing now also exposes a dedicated `Tax Compliance` workspace with VAT/issuer readiness, business-customer VAT-gap review, and invoice follow-up lanes, so phase-1 compliance triage has a real operator queue instead of only scattered settings and invoice snippets
- `Planned / Near-term`: settings IA must be restructured before settings sprawl becomes technical debt

## 10. Payment Operations UI

WebAdmin must provide operational payment support.

### Current state

- `Completed foundation`: generic payment list/edit and payment-linked order/invoice visibility exist
- `Completed foundation`: refund and reconciliation visibility exists
- `Completed foundation`: the payments workspace now also supports queue-style triage for pending, failed, refunded, unlinked, and provider-linked payments, which makes operator support less dependent on ad-hoc search before Stripe-specific lifecycle tooling exists
- `Completed foundation`: the payments workspace now also surfaces live queue counts and phase-1 support playbooks, so operators can move from payment triage into an explicit follow-up path without leaving the workspace
- `Completed foundation`: the global settings UI now also exposes Stripe enablement, publishable/secret/webhook credentials, and merchant display identity needed for phase-1 provider operations
- `Completed foundation`: the payments workspace now also shows a Stripe readiness panel with direct links into payment settings, so configuration gaps are visible from the same operational surface where support triages payments
- `Completed foundation`: the same workspace now also supports Stripe-specific queue subsets for Stripe rows, failed-Stripe cases, and missing provider references, with richer created/paid/failure context per row so phase-1 provider triage is not trapped inside generic payment lists
- `Completed foundation`: the payment editor now also includes lifecycle cards, failure visibility, refund timeline, and Stripe-aware support playbooks, so payment operators can troubleshoot one payment end-to-end without falling back to only the queue row or the linked order
- `Completed foundation`: payment queue rows, order-payment rows, and the payment editor now also deep-link directly into the refund-create workflow with the payment preselected, so support can move from payment troubleshooting into refund recording without manually re-navigating the full order flow
- `Completed foundation`: WebAdmin now also includes a dedicated cross-order refund queue with pending/completed/failed/Stripe subsets, live counts, and direct links back into the linked payment and order workflows, so finance support is no longer trapped inside individual order tabs
- `Completed foundation`: that refund queue now also exposes a `Needs Support` subset and summary signal that combines pending, failed, and Stripe-reference-light refund rows, so finance triage no longer depends on manually combining multiple refund subsets
- `Completed foundation`: the same payment workspace now also surfaces webhook lifecycle visibility and a dedicated webhook queue for subscription/delivery callback history, so Stripe-first finance support can inspect callback drift and retry-pending signals before treating queue rows as reconciled
- `Completed foundation`: the billing webhook queue now also behaves as an HTMX-aware workspace, with filter/reset, queue subsets, and returns to payments/settings staying inside the same fragment workflow, so payment-support triage no longer mixes modern queue handoff with older full-page callback navigation
- `In Progress`: payment operations are now more Stripe-aware for support triage, but webhook lifecycle history, reconciliation, and dispute-depth are still near-term work

### Required near-term capabilities

- payment list
- payment detail
- provider references
- status history
- refund action/support
- reconciliation-state visibility
- dispute visibility
- order/invoice linkage
- webhook/callback audit visibility

### Phase-1 provider direction

WebAdmin payment operations should optimize for Stripe first. Additional providers are later-phase work.

## 11. Shipping Operations UI

WebAdmin must provide shipping visibility and operator support.

### Current state

- `Completed foundation`: shipments are visible through order-related flows, shipping methods now have a dedicated WebAdmin module with list/create/edit, queue filters, and editable rate tiers, and operators now also have a cross-order shipment queue for packing and hand-off review
- `Completed foundation`: that shipment queue now also includes missing-tracking and returned subsets, which makes generic carrier follow-up and return-review workflows more actionable before dedicated DHL-first exception tooling exists
- `Completed foundation`: the shipment queue now also surfaces live operational counts and support playbooks for pending, missing-tracking, and returned work, so operators have a guided phase-1 follow-up path before deeper DHL exception tooling lands
- `Completed foundation`: the global settings UI now also exposes DHL enablement, environment/API credentials, account number, and default shipper identity, so phase-1 carrier configuration is centrally manageable
- `Completed foundation`: the shipment queue now also shows a DHL readiness panel with direct links into shipping settings, so carrier-setup gaps are visible from the same workspace used for shipment follow-up
- `Completed foundation`: the shipment queue now also supports DHL-only and missing-service subsets, carries forward the configured DHL environment, and flags rows needing carrier review, so phase-1 DHL triage is more explicit from the main queue
- `Planned / Near-term`: dedicated DHL-first shipment operations, tracking, and exception handling still need to be strengthened

### Required near-term capabilities

- shipment list
- shipment detail
- tracking timeline
- label info
- delivery exceptions
- return shipment / return request visibility
- manual intervention/support actions

### Phase-1 provider direction

Shipping operations should optimize for DHL first. Additional carriers are later-phase work.

## 12. Loyalty and Mobile Operations

Loyalty and mobile support are now part of the operational scope of WebAdmin, not only backend/application code.

### Loyalty coverage now in WebAdmin

- loyalty program list/create/edit/delete
- reward-tier list/create/edit/delete
- loyalty account queue with search and status filters
- admin-side loyalty account creation for support-led provisioning
- loyalty account detail with recent transactions and redemptions
- manual points adjustment
- account suspend / activate
- redemption workspace with pending/completed/cancelled filters and direct confirm actions for pending items
- business campaign list/create/edit/activate/deactivate
- recent scan-session diagnostics for business-mobile QR flows

### Why this matters

`Darwin.Mobile.Business` already uses reward configuration, campaigns, and scan-session flows. WebAdmin therefore needs enough surface to let operators:

- configure the loyalty program itself
- manage business-facing campaign content and activation
- inspect member account state and intervene with manual adjustments
- review recent scan/accrual/redemption session behavior when support issues happen

### Remaining near-term loyalty/mobile gaps

- deeper mobile remediation or telemetry only if support requirements justify it, such as push-delivery diagnostics, per-device remediation actions, or richer scanner/session failure correlation
- mobile diagnostics are now also on the shared de/en resource path, loyalty/mobile handoff links are first-class inside the workspace, and operator playbooks now explicitly connect push-token debt, scan-session follow-up, and transport-readiness review before support escalates app-only incidents

### Current mobile-operations coverage

The dedicated `Mobile Operations` workspace currently provides:

- JWT and device-binding bootstrap visibility
- QR refresh and mobile outbox bootstrap settings
- onboarding/support dependency counts that affect business-mobile usage
- transport-readiness visibility for email/SMS/WhatsApp/admin alerts
- device-fleet snapshot across active installs
- app-version visibility by platform
- pageable device list with filters for stale installs, missing push tokens, notifications-disabled devices, and business-member devices
- lightweight remediation actions for support: clear push token and deactivate device
- admin-side staff access badge preview/refresh for business members when support needs to mirror the mobile QR badge
- direct links into support queue, site settings, and scan-session review
- row-level handoffs from device diagnostics into loyalty accounts, loyalty scan sessions, and communication provider review when app, scan, and transport incidents overlap
- mobile-used bootstrap validation and misconfiguration feedback now also route through the shared application validation resources instead of raw English-only failure text

The admin dashboard now also exposes a compact loyalty/mobile snapshot so operators can jump directly into loyalty accounts, pending redemptions, scan sessions, and device diagnostics from the landing page instead of relying only on sidebar navigation.

This is intentionally an operational workspace, not yet a full mobile observability and remediation suite.

The identity support chain now also hands mobile-linked users directly into `Mobile Operations` and loyalty account review from the main user queue, so account remediation does not have to rediscover the same person through a separate device-only workspace first.

## 13. Communication Management UI

Communication is a platform capability and must be visible in WebAdmin.

### Required capabilities

- email template management
- notification template management
- communication logs
- resend/retry actions where applicable
- delivery status visibility
- per-business communication settings

### Current state

- `In Progress`: platform communication management now supports operationally safe phase-1 email troubleshooting plus provider-backed SMS/WhatsApp transport tests with customizable diagnostic templates and canonical SMS/WhatsApp phone verification with persisted preferred-channel/fallback policy and customizable text templates, but is not yet complete enough for a full multi-channel template/delivery-log platform
- `Completed foundation`: business setup now exposes a readiness summary that compares business-level communication preferences with global transport configuration, reducing onboarding ambiguity before full template/logging management exists
- `Completed foundation`: dashboard-level communication-operations metrics now expose transport readiness and business communication-default gaps, giving operators an earlier signal before delivery failures become support tickets
- `Completed foundation`: a dedicated `Business Communications` workspace now gives operators a read-only operational queue for businesses missing support-email or sender defaults, with direct links back into business setup and global transport settings
- `Completed foundation`: that workspace now also includes a pageable business queue, so operators can work communication setup debt as an explicit list instead of relying only on dashboard counts
- `Completed foundation`: the workspace also catalogs the currently live transactional email flows and labels them correctly as hard-coded phase-1 compositions, which reduces confusion before the real Communication Core template/log implementation lands
- `Completed foundation`: the workspace now also supports operator queue filters for missing support-email, missing sender identity, and policy-enabled subsets, making communication debt triage more actionable
- `Completed foundation`: current SMTP-based transactional emails now write `EmailDispatchAudit` records, and the workspace surfaces recent delivery attempts/failures as a stopgap audit trail before the full Communication Core logging pipeline exists
- `Completed foundation`: the same workspace now includes a full email audit-log page with search and status filters, which turns delivery visibility into an operator workflow rather than a dashboard-only preview
- `Completed foundation`: each queued business can now be opened into a communication-profile detail screen that combines business defaults, global transport dependency state, current phase-1 flow implications, and support/onboarding signals in one troubleshooting view
- `Completed foundation`: site settings now also expose transactional email subject-prefix and test-inbox reroute controls, and those controls are visible inside the communication workspace so operators can see when phase-1 invitation/activation/password-reset emails are being prefixed or rerouted
- `Completed foundation`: site settings now also expose editable transactional email subject/body templates for business invitation, account activation, and password-reset flows, and those phase-1 flows now consume the configured templates with placeholder rendering instead of remaining fully hard-coded
- `Completed foundation`: the same workspace now also exposes an operator-safe test-email action that only targets the configured communication test inbox, so SMTP readiness and reroute policy can be validated from the admin UI without emailing real customers
- `Completed foundation`: site settings now also expose phase-1 SMS and WhatsApp test recipients plus customizable phone-verification text templates, and the communication workspace now supports provider-backed SMS/WhatsApp transport test sends rather than visibility-only rollout placeholders
- `Completed foundation`: phase-1 email delivery audits now also store flow classification and optional business correlation, so operators can distinguish invitation, activation, and password-reset email failures without waiting for the full Communication Core delivery model
- `Completed foundation`: the workspace now also includes an explicit capability-coverage matrix for template management, retry/resend, and delivery visibility, so operators are not misled into assuming Communication Core features already exist when they do not
- `Completed foundation`: the same workspace now also exposes a template-inventory matrix and a resend/retry policy matrix, so operators can see which flows still use hard-coded composition, what support action is safe today, and where a generic replay engine still does not exist
- `Completed foundation`: each business communication-profile screen now also surfaces recommended next actions and recent business-scoped email activity, so operators can move from diagnosis into support/setup action without leaving the communication workspace
- `Completed foundation`: the business communication-profile screen now also carries a local template-inventory snapshot and resend/retry policy snapshot, so operators can keep flow-control context while troubleshooting one business instead of bouncing back to the top-level communication workspace
- `Completed foundation`: the email audit-log now also includes flow-specific operator playbooks, failed-flow quick filters, and business-linked shortcuts, which makes invitation/activation/password-reset failures actionable without pretending a generic retry queue already exists
- `Completed foundation`: the email-audit queue now also supports controlled generic retry for failed or pending invitation, activation, and password-reset flows after safe live-target resolution, so operators can recover common transactional email failures without pretending a blind replay engine exists
- `Completed foundation`: the communication workspace, business profile, and email-audit queue now also expose prior-attempt counts, repeated-failure chains, and last-success context for the same flow/recipient/business path, so delivery triage can distinguish isolated failures from recurring operational debt before a fuller outbox/delivery-history model exists
- `Completed foundation`: the email-audit queue now also exposes `repeated failures` and `prior success context` as first-class subset filters and summary cards, so operators can work recurring delivery debt as a queue instead of only inferring it from per-row context
- `Completed foundation`: the same email-audit queue now also exposes `Retry Ready` and `Retry Blocked` policy subsets, cooldown/rate-limit reasons, retry-available timing, and recent 24-hour chain-attempt volume, so support can tell when replay is safe, when it should wait, and when it should stop before duplicate-email storms degrade trust
- `Completed foundation`: the same queue now also exposes `Heavy Chains` triage together with chain span and status-mix context for the same flow/recipient/business path, so operators can separate one-off incidents from recurring delivery instability before a fuller provider-event and outbox model exists
- `Completed foundation`: exact-chain exploration in the email-audit queue now also exposes a chain-level summary for one recipient/flow/business path, including total attempts, fail/sent/pending mix, first/last attempt timing, last-success timing, and follow-up volume, so operators can review one delivery incident as a coherent chain instead of assembling that context manually
- `Completed foundation`: exact-chain exploration now also includes a recent delivery-history preview for the same recipient/flow/business path, so operators can read the last few attempt outcomes, provider path, and failure messages without reconstructing the incident manually from the paged queue
- `Completed foundation`: exact-chain exploration now also supports chain-local `Needs Follow-up` and `Resolved History` navigation, so operators can separate unresolved incidents from already-settled attempts without dropping back to broad queue filters
- `Completed foundation`: the Business Communications workspace and business-profile troubleshooting flow now also expose a cross-channel truth matrix for Email, SMS, and WhatsApp, so operators can see which flows are truly live, which actions are safe today, and where the platform intentionally still stops short of a generic multi-channel replay bus
- `Completed foundation`: the phase-1 communication flow catalog now also treats SMS and WhatsApp test-send paths as live operator validation flows rather than future-only placeholders, which keeps rollout expectations aligned with the actual provider-backed capability already in the system
- `Completed foundation`: phone verification now also has a persisted platform channel policy with preferred channel and optional SMS/WhatsApp fallback, so Web and Mobile can rely on one backend-owned verification rule instead of inventing client-side channel selection behavior
- `Completed foundation`: live SMS and WhatsApp sends for phone verification and operator transport tests now also write persisted `ChannelDispatchAudit` rows, and those rows are surfaced in the communication workspace and business profile as a multi-channel history baseline, so support can inspect non-email delivery behavior instead of treating SMS/WhatsApp as opaque transports
- `Completed foundation`: the multi-channel audit baseline now also includes a dedicated `SMS / WhatsApp Audits` workspace with queue filters and business-scoped drill-in, so non-email delivery incidents can be worked as an operator list rather than only as summary cards
- `Completed foundation`: that same `SMS / WhatsApp Audits` workspace now also supports exact-chain exploration for one recipient/flow/business path with `Needs Follow-up` and `Resolved History` slices, so phone-verification and transport-test incidents can be diagnosed as chains the same way email incidents now are
- `Completed foundation`: those same non-email exact-chain views now also deep-link into verification policy, SMS/WhatsApp settings, message-template surfaces, and safe admin-test reruns without dropping the operator out of the incident queue, so SMS and WhatsApp support is now operationally actionable instead of dashboard-only
- `Completed foundation`: the same non-email audit queue now also highlights `Repeated Failures` and `Prior Success Context` with per-row prior-attempt, prior-failure, and last-success signals, so operators can separate recurring transport or verification instability from one-off failures before escalating
- `Completed foundation`: the same non-email audit queue now also exposes `Provider Review` triage with 24-hour provider-lane attempt/failure pressure on each row, so operators can distinguish recipient-specific incidents from transport/provider instability before a fuller provider-event model exists
- `Completed foundation`: that same non-email queue now also supports provider-lane drill-in with a provider-scoped 24-hour summary and direct provider-lane navigation from each row, so SMS and WhatsApp provider issues can be worked as lane incidents instead of only inferred from row-level pressure signals
- `Completed foundation`: provider-lane drill-in now also includes a recommended next step and escalation rule per provider lane, so operators can move from transport pressure visibility into the right configuration or policy action without inventing their own provider playbook
- `Completed foundation`: provider-lane review now also includes direct action handoffs into verification policy, SMS/WhatsApp settings, test-target setup, and safe provider-scoped diagnostic reruns while preserving queue context, so transport pressure can be worked from the same incident surface instead of only read as guidance
- `Completed foundation`: that same provider-lane review now also exposes recovery state and last-success timing, so operators can tell whether a provider lane has actually stabilized after failures instead of inferring recovery manually from individual rows
- `Completed foundation`: the same non-email queue now also surfaces real action-policy state (`ready`, `retry ready`, `cooldown`, `canonical flow`, `unsupported`) and enforces cooldown on admin transport-test reruns in backend code, so SMS/WhatsApp operator actions follow policy instead of being UI-only affordances
- `Completed foundation`: those same non-email exact-chain views now also show a recommended next step and escalation rule per flow, so support can move from incident diagnosis into policy-compliant action without reconstructing the playbook manually
- `Completed foundation`: the same non-email queue now also surfaces explicit `Escalation Candidates` with row-level escalation reasons for repeated unresolved verification or transport failures, so operators can distinguish genuine provider/platform debt from incidents that still belong in normal follow-up lanes
- `Completed foundation`: the new `Business Support Queue` links those failed-flow email signals back to business attention/setup/member/invitation actions, so communication failures can be triaged in the same operator workspace as onboarding/support issues
- `Completed foundation`: the same queue now refreshes its summary and triage panels independently via HTMX, improving support responsiveness before a fuller real-time ops surface exists
- `Deferred intentionally`: the remaining communication gaps are now primarily deeper template CRUD, richer delivery-log/outbox modeling, and broader replay policy, rather than missing operator visibility or safe retry for the current live flows

## 32. Deferred Micro-Cleanup

These items are intentionally deferred rather than forgotten:

- ultra-low-traffic HTMX polish on the last microscopic detours that do not block real operator workflows
- cleanup of a few surviving legacy-encoded admin files where touching them now adds more risk than value
- final pruning of transitional redirect and fallback paths after the WebAdmin completion phase is formally closed

## 14. Localization Readiness in WebAdmin

WebAdmin now has a real bilingual baseline and must keep expanding from that base instead of postponing localization.

### Important platform context

- the current required baseline is `de-DE` and `en-US`
- WebAdmin now supports request-culture switching by cookie/query-string and reads supported cultures from site settings
- shared admin chrome, auth screens, and early operator surfaces such as Site Settings, Business Communications, email/channel audits, Orders, Businesses, CRM overview/customers, billing payments/refunds/webhooks/payment-detail, inventory warehouses/stock levels, and business support/setup are already moving onto bilingual rendering
- key operational feedback is also starting to move onto the same de/en baseline through shared alert text plus CRM/inventory success-not-found-concurrency messages, so bilingual coverage is no longer limited to headings and list shells
- billing success/not-found/concurrency feedback plus several lower-traffic billing, shipping-method, and identity editor forms are now also moving onto that same baseline, so bilingual coverage continues from queue/detail screens into finance/support corrective flows
- the same key-based bilingual path is now also being applied to auth, identity, settings, and shipping-method hard-coded feedback, so de/en support is beginning to cover operational validation and recovery messages instead of stopping at headings and TempData in only a few modules
- the localization implementation is now also starting to shift toward the standard ASP.NET Core `resx`/`IStringLocalizer` path, with the older in-code dictionary retained only as a migration fallback so additional languages can be introduced through resource files instead of expanding one giant hard-coded map forever
- that `resx-first` path now also begins to cover shared DataAnnotations localization, which is important because a bilingual admin is not complete if labels and validation metadata still depend on hard-coded English attribute strings
- the migration is also starting to move more shared editor/action/form keys into `resx`, so the current bilingual runtime is gradually becoming resource-file-driven in practice instead of only in architecture
- the resource structure has also been normalized around a root-level `SharedResource` and `Resources/SharedResource*.resx`, which is a better fit for the current shared-key model than hiding the first resource files under an unnecessary subfolder
- identity form metadata is now also beginning to use that same shared `resx` path for labels and validation strings, which matters because a multilingual admin is not really complete if password/email/profile forms still lean on hard-coded attribute text
- future languages must be additive on top of this baseline rather than forcing a redesign

### Required design rules

- avoid hard-coded labels where practical
- keep settings/categories/messages translation-friendly
- maintain German and English parity on high-traffic operator surfaces now
- keep translation plumbing extensible so future languages can be added without rewriting request-localization or screen contracts
- keep templates and system messages ready for later localization

## 15. Security and Performance Concerns

These are non-functional requirements for WebAdmin, not optional nice-to-haves.

### Security

- permission-aware UI
- safe admin action protection
- auditability
- tenant isolation awareness
- PII protection
- secure handling of activation/reset/support flows
- rate-limiting awareness for sensitive paths

### Performance

- pagination/filtering/search for large datasets
- efficient dashboard and list projections
- responsive partial updates
- avoid over-fetching
- background/async handling where provider callbacks or communication delivery are involved

## 16. Controller and View Responsibilities

### Controllers should

- call application handlers
- map DTOs to view models
- return full views for full-page loads
- return partials/shells for HTMX fragment requests
- keep responses authoritative for validation and operator feedback

### Controllers should not

- manipulate EF entities directly
- duplicate domain/application validation
- push complex business rules into page JavaScript

### Views should

- remain server-rendered and thin
- prefer HTMX attributes over custom fetch code
- preserve concurrency tokens such as `RowVersion`
- reuse shared modal, alert, pager, and partial patterns

- `Completed foundation`: loyalty accounts, scan sessions, and redemptions now also expose ops summaries and operator playbooks, so member-balance support, scanner diagnostics, and redemption triage are no longer table-only workspaces
- Completed foundation: loyalty filter labels and loyalty/mobile operator playbooks now also route through SharedResource*.resx, and the Mobile Operations workspace now exposes explicit loyalty follow-up handoffs plus localized playbooks/feedback, so the remaining loyalty/mobile priority area is no longer split between bilingual loyalty queues and an English-only mobile diagnostics surface
- `Completed foundation`: loyalty workspaces now render shared alert partials and controller fallbacks for account creation, campaign creation/update, point adjustments, activation, and redemption confirmation, so HTMX-driven loyalty support no longer loses feedback inside fragment refresh paths
- `Completed foundation`: a focused completion review on the priority chains found that pagination was still falling back to plain `<pager>` navigation; the shared pager tag helper now supports HTMX targets/push-url, and the priority loyalty/access/subscriber-support/payment queues now page in-place instead of breaking out to full-page responses
- `Completed foundation`: business archive/remove destructive actions on the main business, location, and member queues now carry HTMX modal context, so confirm-delete flows rerender the same workspace shell instead of degrading back to plain full-page post/redirect behavior
- `Completed foundation`: Business Communications and Email Audits now render through HTMX-aware workspace helpers, and the communication test/send, filter, pagination, and profile/audit navigation paths stay inside the newer server-rendered workflow instead of bouncing back to plain full-page responses
- `Completed foundation`: email-audit rows now expose direct operator handoffs into invitation support, user-account support, communication policy, and business setup/profile workspaces, which turns the phase-1 delivery log into an actionable support surface instead of a read-only audit table

- `Completed foundation`: the global shipment queue now also exposes direct `Refunds` and `Start Return Refund` handoffs for returned or carrier-review rows, and the order-level shipment grid now pushes returned/carrier-review rows toward the refund tab, so phase-1 return support is no longer trapped behind an order-detail detour
- `Completed foundation`: the shipment workspace now also exposes a dedicated `Return Follow-up` subset with queue counts, row badges, and direct refund/carrier-review handoffs, so returned parcels needing refund-path or carrier-completion review are no longer mixed into the general returned bucket
- `Completed foundation`: carrier-exception rows in the shipment queue and order shipment grid now also deep-link directly into `Shipping Methods` or `Shipping Settings` when missing-service or threshold/tracking issues are the likely next operator step, so DHL troubleshooting no longer stops at passive exception notes
- `Completed foundation`: the email-audit workspace now includes an operational summary panel for total, failed, sent, pending, last-24-hour activity, and failed-flow buckets, which makes Communication Core triage more actionable without pretending a generic resend engine already exists
- `Completed foundation`: Communication Core inventory and resend-policy matrices now also hand off directly into failed-audit subsets and the safe operator workspace for each flow, so these tables are no longer passive documentation surfaces
- `Completed foundation`: the email-audit workspace now also supports `stale pending` and `business-linked failure` triage, so operators can separate transport-latency issues from business-scoped follow-up without waiting for a full Communication Core queue/outbox model

- `Completed foundation`: the `Business Communications` index now also opens with an execution rail for transport readiness, tenant setup gaps, email retry/escalation queues, and channel provider-review lanes, so operators can move from top-level communication triage into support, policy, retry-ready, retry-blocked, heavy-chain, and provider-review follow-up without reading through the full workspace first.
- `Completed foundation`: the `EmailAudits` workspace now also opens with a retry-and-chain execution rail for retry-ready, retry-blocked, repeated-failure, heavy-chain, stale-pending, and exact-chain follow-up, so operators can move from queue entry into retry/support/policy remediation without first scanning the full audit grid.
- `Completed foundation`: the `ChannelAudits` workspace now also opens with an execution rail for action-ready, action-blocked, escalation, provider-review, and chain-attention follow-up, so operators can move from queue entry into provider, policy, and chain remediation without first scanning the full non-email audit grid.
- `Completed foundation`: the business-scoped `Communication Details` profile now also opens with an execution rail for setup gaps, member/invitation attention, email follow-up, and channel/provider escalation, so operators can move from one tenant profile into support, setup, policy, email-audit, and channel-audit remediation without first reading through the full profile.
- `Completed foundation`: the Business Communications workspace and business communication profile now also show the live invitation, activation, and password-reset subject/body template previews plus supported-token hints, so operators can inspect current template truth without leaving the communication workflow for site settings
- `Completed foundation`: failed invitation, activation, and password-reset audit rows now deep-link into recipient-scoped invitation or member/user support surfaces, so controlled flow-specific resend follow-up is no longer just a generic recommendation string

- `Completed foundation`: payment and refund queue rows now also expose direct reconciliation/support/dispute queue jumps plus HTMX-safe links into order, customer, invoice, and payment workspaces, so Stripe-first follow-up no longer depends on mixing queue triage with plain-link detours
- `Completed foundation`: the orders queue and order-details workspace now also render through HTMX-aware helpers, and add-payment/shipment/refund/invoice flows now return through the same shell-based workflow, so post-order operations no longer mix fragment-driven follow-up with older full-page queue/detail detours
- `Completed foundation`: CRM customer creation now uses the same HTMX-aware editor entry path as the rest of the customer workflow, and the segments workspace plus customer/segment back-navigation now also stay inside shell-based search/filter/edit flows, which closes another set of lower-traffic CRM detours found during the completion audit
- `Completed foundation`: low-traffic admin feedback debt is now reduced further across permissions, roles, media, orders, and loyalty controllers; the remaining user-visible TempData success/error/warning strings in those surfaces now route through `SharedResource*.resx`, so de/en consistency is no longer limited to the high-traffic queues and editors
- `Completed foundation`: another low-traffic admin feedback pass now covers business lifecycle/setup/member support and product maintenance controllers, so business onboarding/support and product CRUD no longer fall back to raw English TempData messaging while the surrounding WebAdmin shell is localized
- `Completed foundation`: CRM create/edit/convert/support actions now use resource-backed fallback feedback when exceptions do not surface a better localized message, and the interaction/consent/segment partial workspaces now render shared alerts inside their HTMX sections, so CRM operators no longer miss action feedback inside those embedded support surfaces
- `Completed foundation`: the CRM customers workspace now also exposes summary cards, customer-ops counts, and operator playbooks for locale fallback, segmentation gaps, and missing VAT follow-up, so the customer queue is less table-only and more usable as a day-to-day support workbench
- `Completed foundation`: the CRM customer editor now also embeds live interaction, consent, and segment sections plus follow-up actions for opportunity creation and invoice review, so customer maintenance no longer depends on bouncing between multiple CRM screens just to inspect the current support context
- `Completed foundation`: the CRM lead and opportunity editors now also embed their live interaction sections and carry direct follow-up handoffs to linked customer, opportunity creation, and invoice review lanes, so conversion and pipeline maintenance rely less on screen-to-screen hopping during support work
- `Completed foundation`: the CRM invoice editor now also exposes a dedicated follow-up action block for linked customer, order, payment trail, and related invoices, and its status/refund feedback now routes through shared localized messages instead of raw inline strings
- `Completed foundation`: the CRM leads and opportunities workspaces now also expose ops summaries and operator playbooks for qualification, ownership, conversion, close-date pressure, and high-interaction review, so queue triage is less table-only and closer to the richer editor workbenches

- Products workspace and product editors now use shared de/en resource keys, operator notes, and localized product playbooks for catalog readiness work.
- `Completed foundation`: the business support queue header now exposes direct lifecycle shortcuts for suspended businesses, pending activation, and locked members in addition to the newer merchant-readiness subsets, so support operators can jump into the right lifecycle lane without first traversing the summary cards or broader queue slices.
- `Completed foundation`: business-linked failed-email rows in the support queue now deep-link directly into scoped email-audit and SMS/WhatsApp-audit lanes in addition to the broader communication profile, so communication remediation can start from the failure card itself instead of routing back through broader workspace entry points.
- `Completed foundation`: the business support queue header now exposes a direct `PendingApproval` shortcut in the same HTMX-safe lifecycle lane set as approved-inactive and suspended business slices, so approval triage can start from the workspace entry without detouring through summary cards first.
- `Completed foundation`: the support-queue summary now gives `NeedsAttention` a direct `Merchant Readiness` handoff and lets the invitations card pivot either into failed invitation audits or the `PendingInvites` business subset, so summary-driven support triage is less single-entry and closer to the remediation lane the operator actually needs.
- `Completed foundation`: the support-queue summary now also gives `PendingApproval` and `SuspendedBusinesses` direct `Merchant Readiness` handoffs in addition to their queue-specific paths, so lifecycle triage can pivot from raw subset review into the richer merchant-remediation workspace without leaving the summary layer.
- `Completed foundation`: the support-queue summary now gives the `BusinessesMissingOwner` card a direct remediation handoff toward the merchant/member lane instead of only a raw subset jump, so owner-gap triage can move from detection to the next operational workspace without leaving the summary layer.
- `Completed foundation`: the support-queue summary now also gives `LockedMembers` a direct mobile-operations handoff in addition to user and password-reset lanes, so member lockout triage can pivot into device-state investigation without leaving the summary layer.
- `Completed foundation`: account-activation failed-email rows in the support queue now also hand off directly into mobile operations in addition to member and unconfirmed-user lanes, so activation-failure triage can pivot into device-state investigation from the failure card itself.
- `Completed foundation`: password-reset failed-email rows in the support queue now also hand off directly into mobile operations in addition to user and locked-user lanes, so recovery triage can pivot into device-state investigation from the failure card itself.
- `Completed foundation`: the support-queue summary now keeps the `BusinessesMissingOwner` remediation handoff labeled as `Merchant Readiness` instead of a misleading member-specific label, so the owner-gap card matches its actual target workspace and avoids sending operators toward the wrong mental model.
- `Completed foundation`: the support-queue summary now also gives `PendingInvites` a direct `Merchant Readiness` handoff in addition to the queue and failed-email paths, so invitation-gap triage can pivot into the richer merchant-remediation workspace without leaving the summary layer.

- `Completed foundation`: account-activation failed-email rows in the support queue now also hand off directly into `Merchant Readiness` in addition to member, unconfirmed-user, and mobile-operations paths, so activation-failure triage can pivot into the richer merchant-remediation workspace from the failure card itself.
- `Completed foundation`: password-reset failed-email rows in the support queue now also hand off directly into `Merchant Readiness` in addition to user, locked-user, and mobile-operations paths, so recovery triage can pivot into the richer merchant-remediation workspace from the failure card itself.
- `Completed foundation`: business-linked failed-email rows in the support queue now also expose a direct `Merchant Readiness` handoff inside their generic action cluster, so communication-failure triage can pivot into the richer merchant-remediation workspace without depending only on flow-specific branches.
- `Completed foundation`: the support-queue header now labels its `attentionOnly` business-queue shortcut as `Needs Attention` instead of the broader `Businesses`, so the entry workspace matches the actual slice it opens and avoids sending operators toward the wrong queue expectation.
- `Completed foundation`: the support-queue summary no longer keeps a stale inline tail for locked-user/mobile/password-reset links after those signals were promoted into full remediation cards, so the summary layer is less mixed and less likely to send operators through redundant paths.
- `Completed foundation`: the attention-businesses card in the support queue now labels its `attentionOnly` business-queue jump as `Needs Attention` instead of `FullQueue`, so that drill-in matches the actual subset it opens and avoids sending operators toward the wrong queue expectation.
- `Completed foundation`: support-queue summary cards that open precise readiness subsets now use subset-specific labels such as `ApprovedInactive`, `MissingPrimaryLocation`, `MissingContactEmail`, `MissingLegalName`, `BusinessesMissingOwner`, and `PendingInvites` instead of the generic `OpenBusinessQueue`, so drill-ins match the actual slice they open and avoid sending operators toward a broader queue expectation.
- `Completed foundation`: the remaining support-queue summary drill-ins for `PendingInvites` and `SuspendedBusinesses` now also use slice-specific labels instead of a generic business-queue phrasing, so those lifecycle/support cards match the exact subset they open.
- `Completed foundation`: the `NeedsAttention` card in the support-queue summary now labels its drill-in with the exact attention slice instead of a generic business-queue phrasing, so that summary card matches the subset it actually opens.
- `Completed foundation`: the `PendingApproval` card in the support-queue summary now labels its drill-in with the exact approval slice instead of a separate open-queue phrasing, so that lifecycle card matches the subset it actually opens and stays consistent with the newer precision drill-ins.

- Dashboard CRM finance subset depth: the CRM dashboard card now also deep-links into CRM invoice subsets for Overdue, DueSoon, Draft, MissingVatId, and Refunded plus Billing payment subsets for Pending, Unlinked, and Refunded, so home-level CRM finance triage can move from the dashboard into the exact invoice or payment remediation lane instead of stopping at the generic CRM workspace.

- Dashboard communications execution depth: the communication-ops card now also deep-links into communication policy/settings fragments and selected-business profile remediation alongside retry-blocked, heavy-chain, action-blocked, and escalation subsets, so home-level comms triage can move from the dashboard into the exact policy, profile, or audit lane instead of stopping at the generic workspace.

- Settings communications template-family depth: the site-settings communications-policy section now also separates policy/test-target readiness from invitation, activation, password-reset, and phone-verification template-family readiness with direct handoffs into communication ops and support queues, so settings no longer treats communication execution as one flat phase-1 block.
